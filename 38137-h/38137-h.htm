<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>The student of nature lives in a broader and more
interesting world than does he who has not learned the
story of the birds, the streams, the fields, the woods, and
the hedgerows. So, too, the student of local history
finds his present interest in town, village, city, or State,
growing with his knowledge of its past.</p>

<p>In recognition of this fact, these true stories, selected
from Wisconsin's history, have been written as a means
to the cultivation of civic patriotism among the youth
of our commonwealth. It is not the purpose of the
book to present a continuous account of the development
of the State; for this, the author begs to refer to
his larger work, "The Story of Wisconsin" (in the
Story of the States Series). Rather is it desired to
give selections from the interesting and often stirring
incidents with which our history is so richly stored, in
the hope that the reader may acquire a taste for delving
more deeply into the annals of the Badger State.</p>

<p>Wisconsin had belonged, in turn, to Spain, France,
and England, before she became a portion of the United
States. Her recorded history begins far back in the
time of French ownership, in 1634. The century and
a third of the French r&eacute;gime was a picturesque period,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
upon which the memory delights to dwell; with its
many phases, several of the following chapters are concerned.
The English r&eacute;gime was brief, but not without
interest. In the long stretch of years which followed,
before Wisconsin became an American State, many incidents
happened which possess for us the flavor of
romance. The formative period between 1848 and 1861
was replete with striking events. In the War of Secession,
Wisconsin took a gallant and notable part. Since
that great struggle, the State has made giant strides in
industry, commerce, education, and culture; but the
present epoch of growth has not thus far yielded much
material for picturesque treatment, perhaps because we
are still too near to the events to see them in proper
perspective. An attempt has been made to present
chapters representative of all these periods, but naturally
the earlier times have seemed best adapted to the
purpose in hand.</p>

<h2>STORIES OF THE BADGER STATE</h2>

<h2 id="THE_MOUND_BUILDERS">THE MOUND BUILDERS</h2>

<p>In the basin of the Mississippi, particularly in that
portion lying east of the great river, there are numerous
mounds which were reared by human beings,
apparently in very early times, before American history
begins. They are found most frequently upon the
banks of lakes and rivers, and often upon the summits
of high bluffs overlooking the country. No attempt
has ever been made to count them, for they could be
numbered by tens of thousands; in the small county
of Trempealeau, Wisconsin, for instance, over two
thousand have been found by surveyors. Most of the
mounds have been worn down, by hundreds of years of
exposure to rain and frost, till they are but two or
three feet in height; a few, however, still retain so
majestic an altitude as eighty or more feet. The conical
mounds are called by ethnologists <i>tumuli</i>. Other
earthworks are long lines, or squares, or circles, and
are probably fortifications; some of the best examples
of these are still to be traced at Aztalan, Wisconsin.
In many places, especially in Ohio and Wisconsin,
they have been so shaped as to resemble buffaloes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
serpents, lizards, squirrels, or birds; and some apparently
were designed to represent clubs, bows, or spears&mdash;all
these peculiarly shaped mounds being styled
<i>effigies</i>.</p>

<p>The mounds attracted the attention of some of the
earliest white travelers in the Mississippi basin, and
much was written about them in books published in
Europe over a hundred years ago. Books are still
being written about the mounds, but most of them are
based on old and worn-out theories; those published
by the Ethnological Bureau, at Washington, are the
latest and best. Many thousands of these earthworks
have been opened, some by scientists, many more by
curiosity seekers, and their contents have, for the most
part, found their way into public museums. Many of
the mounds have been measured with great accuracy,
and pictures and descriptions of them are common.</p>

<p>Until a few years ago, the opinion was quite general,
even among historians and ethnologists, that the
mounds were built by a race of people who lived in
the Mississippi basin before the coming of the Indians,
and that the mound builders were far superior to the
Indians in civilization. Many thought that this prehistoric
race had been driven southward by the Indians,
and that the Aztecs whom the Spaniards found in Mexico
and Central America four hundred years ago were
its descendants. We have in Wisconsin a reminder of
the Aztec theory, in the name Aztalan, early applied
to a notable group of earthworks in Jefferson county.</p>

<p>There were many reasons why, in an earlier and
more imperfect stage of our knowledge concerning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
Indians, this theory seemed plausible. It was argued
that to build all these mounds required a vast deal of
steady labor, which could have been performed only by
a dense population, working under some strong central
authority, perhaps in a condition of slavery; that these
people must have long resided in the same spot; and
must have been supported by regular crops of grain,
vegetables, and fruit. It was shown that Indians, as
we found them, lived in small bands, and did not abide
long in one place; that their system of government was
a loose democracy; that they were disinclined to persistent
labor, and that they were hunters, not farmers.
Further, it was contended that the mounds indicated a
religious belief on the part of their builders, which was
not the religion of the red men. The result of these
arguments, to which was added a good deal of romantic
fancy, was to rear in the public mind a highly colored
conception of a mythical race of Mound Builders, rivaling
in civilization the ancient Egyptians.</p>

<p>But we are living in an age of scientific investigation;
scientific methods are being applied to every branch of
study; history has had to be rewritten for us in the
new light which is being thrown upon the path of
human development. This is not the place to set forth
in detail the steps by which knowledge has been slowly
but surely reached, regarding the history of the once
mysterious mounds. The work of research is not yet
ended, for the study of ethnology is only in its infancy;
nevertheless, it is now well established that the Indians
built the mounds, and we may feel reasonably certain
for what purpose they used them.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>Indian population was never dense in North America.
The best judges now agree that the entire native
population consisted of not over two hundred thousand
at the time when the Pilgrim Fathers came to Plymouth.
Of these, Wisconsin probably had but nine
thousand, which, curiously enough, is about its present
Indian population. But, before the first whites came,
many of the American tribes were not such roamers
as they afterward became; they were inclined to gather
into villages, and to raise large crops of Indian corn,
melons, and pumpkins, the surplus of which they dried
and stored for winter. We shall read, in another chapter,
how the white fur trader came to induce the Indian
agriculturist to turn hunter, and thereby to become the
wandering savage whom we know to-day. Concerning
the argument that the modern Indian is too lazy
to build mounds, it is sufficient to say that he was,
when a planter, of necessity a better worker than when
he had become a hunter; also, that many of the statements
we read about Indian laziness are the result of
popular misunderstanding of the state of Indian society.
It is now well known that the Indian was quite
capable of building excellent fortifications; that the
most complicated forms of mounds were not beyond
his capacity; and that, in general, he was in a more
advanced stage of mental development than was generally
believed by old writers. Modern experiments,
also, prove that the actual work of building a mound,
with the aid of baskets to carry the earth, which was
the method that they are known to have employed,
was not so great as has been supposed.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<div id="i1119">&nbsp;</div>

<p>It has been recently discovered, from documents of
that period, that certain Indians were actually building
mounds in our southern States as late as the Revolutionary
War. In the north, the practice of mound
building had gone or
was going out of
fashion about a hundred
and twenty-five
years before, that is,
in the days when
the French first came
to Wisconsin. It is
thought that some
of our Wisconsin
mounds may be a
thousand years old;
while others are
certainly not much
over two hundred
years of age, for
skeletons have been
found in some of them
wearing silver ornaments which
were made in Paris, and which
bear dates as late as 1680.</p>

<p>It is easy to imagine the uses to which the Wisconsin
mounds were put by their Indian builders. We can the
more readily reason this out, because we know, from
books of travel published at the time, just what use
the southern Indians were making of their mounds, in
the period of the Revolutionary War. The small tumuli<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
were for the most part burial places for men of importance,
and were merely heaps of earth piled above the
corpse, which was generally placed in a sitting posture;
he was surrounded with earthen pots containing food,
which was to last him until his arrival at the happy hunting
ground, and with weapons of stone and copper, to
enable him there to kill game or defend himself against
his enemies. The larger tumuli were, no doubt, the
commanding sites of council houses or of the huts of
chiefs. Each Indian belonged, through his relationship
with his mother's people, to some clan; and each
clan had its symbol or <i>totem</i>, such as the Bear, the
Turtle, the Buffalo, etc. The Indians claimed that
the clan had descended from some giant animal whose
figure, or effigy, was thus honored. Many white people
place their family symbol, or crest, or coat of arms on
their letter paper, or on the panels of their carriage
doors, or upon their silverware; so Indians are fond
of displaying their respective totems on their utensils,
weapons, canoes, or wigwams. In the mound building
days, they reared totems of earth, and probably dwelt
on top of them. As in each village there were several
clans, so there were numerous earth totems, many
of them of great size. This, no doubt, is the origin
of the so-called effigies. Add to these the mystic circles
of the medicine men, the fantastic serpents, and
the fortifications necessary to defend the village from
the approach of an enemy up some sloping bank or
sharp-sided ravine, and you have the story of the
mounds. An Indian village in those old mound building
days must have presented a picturesque appearance.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>Just why the Indians stopped building mounds is
not settled; but it is noticeable that they were being
built in various parts of the country about up to the time
of the white man's entry. It may be that the coming
of the stranger, with his different manners, hastened
the decay of the custom; or perhaps it had practically
ceased about that time, as many another wave of custom
has swept over primitive peoples and left only
traces behind.</p>

<p>The mounds, with which the forefathers of our
Indians dotted our land, remain to us as curious and
instructive monuments of savage life in prehistoric
times. No castles or grand cathedrals have come down
to us, in America, to illustrate the story of the early
ages of our own race; but we have in the mounds
mute, impressive relics of a still earlier life upon this
soil, by our primitive predecessors. It should be considered
our duty, as well as our pleasure, to preserve
them intact for the enlightenment of coming generations
of our people.</p>

<h2 id="LIFE_AND_MANNERS_OF_THE_INDIANS">LIFE AND MANNERS OF THE INDIANS</h2>

<p>At the time when white men first came to Wisconsin,
there were found here several widely differing
tribes of Indians, and these were often at war with one
another. The Winnebagoes, an offshoot of the Sioux,
occupied the valleys of the Wisconsin and the Fox, and
the shores of Green Bay as far down as Sturgeon Bay.
If the theory of the ethnologists be correct, that most of
the Wisconsin mounds were built by the Winnebagoes,
then at times they must have dwelt in nearly every corner
of the State. This is not unlikely, for the centers
of Indian population were continually shifting, the red
men being driven hither and thither by encroachments
of enemies, religious fancies, or the never-ending search
for food. We know only that when the whites found
them, they were holding these two valleys, between Green
Bay and Prairie du Chien. A broad-faced people, with
flat noses, they were in personal appearance, habits,
and morals the least attractive of all our tribes. Their
cousins, the wild and dashing Sioux, were still using
northwest Wisconsin as a hunting ground, and had
permanent villages in Minnesota, and elsewhere to the
west of the Mississippi River. The Chippewas (or
Ojibways, as the name was originally spelled), the best
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
of our Wisconsin aborigines, were scattered through
the northern part of the State, as far south as the Black
River, and perhaps as far eastward as the Wolf. East
of them were the Menominees (Wild-Rice Eaters), a
comparatively gentle folk, who gathered great stores of
grain from the broad fields of wild rice which flourishes
in the bayous and marshy river bottoms of northeast
Wisconsin. The Pottawattomies, with feminine cast of
countenance, occupied the islands at the mouth of Green
Bay, and the west shore of Lake Michigan, down into
Illinois. The united Sacs (or Saukies) and Foxes
(Outagamies) were also prominent tribes. When first
seen by whites, the Sacs and Foxes were weak in numbers,
but, being a bold and warlike people, they soon
grew to importance, and crowded the Winnebagoes out
of the Fox valley and, later, out of much of the Wisconsin
valley, becoming in their pride and strength
bitter enemies of the French.</p>

<p>Scattered elsewhere through the State were some
smaller tribes: the Mascoutins (Fire Nation), chiefly in
the neighborhood of the present city of Berlin; the
short-limbed Kickapoos, in the Kickapoo valley; and,
at various periods, bands of Hurons, Illinois, Miamis,
and Ottawas, none of whom ever played a large part
here. The Stockbridges, Oneidas, Brothertowns, and
Munsees, now numerous in northeast Wisconsin, are
remnants of New York and Massachusetts tribes who
were removed hither by the general government in
1822 and later.</p>

<p>No two tribes spoke the same language. In Wisconsin,
the Indians were divided by language into two
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
great families, the Algonkin and the Dakotan. The
Sioux and the Winnebagoes belonged, by their similar
speech, to the Dakotan family, just as the English and
the Germans belong to the great Teutonic family. All
the others were of the Algonkin group, just as the
French, the Spanish, and the Italians belong to what is
called the Latin family, and speak languages which
have the same origin. The Indian history
of Wisconsin is the more interesting, because
here these two great families
or groups met, clashed, and intermingled.
Despite the diversity of
tongues, they were, with certain variations,
much the same sort
of people; and for our present
purpose, the description
of one tribe will serve for
the description of all.</p>

<p>In size, Indians resemble
Europeans; some are shorter
than the average white man,
some taller; the Kickapoos were
among the short men. Indians
have black eyes and coarse, black
hair. Most of them wear no
beard, but as the hairs appear,
pluck them out with tweezers of
wood or clam shell. They have thin lips, high
cheek bones, broad faces, and prominent noses; the
Winnebago's nose is large, but much flattened.</p>

<p>In primitive times, the summer dress of the men was
<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
generally a short apron made of the well-tanned skin of
a wild animal, the women being clothed in skins from
neck to knees; in winter, both sexes wrapped themselves
in large fur robes. In some parts of North
America, especially in the south, where the Indians
were more highly developed than those in the north,
they wove rude cloths of thread spun from buffalo hair,
or of sinews of animals killed in the chase. It is not
supposed that there was much of this cloth made in
Wisconsin. What specimens have been discovered in
our mounds, no doubt were obtained from the native
peddlers, who wandered far and wide carrying the
peculiar products of several tribes, and exchanging
them for other goods, or for wampum, the universal
currency of the forest. Moccasins of deerskin were in
general use; also leggins, with the fur turned inward
or outward according to the weather. Much of their
clothing was stained red or black or yellow; some was
painted in stripes or lace work, and some was decorated
with pictures of birds and beasts, or with scenes which
they wished to commemorate. One old writer quaintly
speaks of "a great skinne painted and drawen and
pourtrayed that nothing lacked but life." Their dress
was also ornamented by beads and porcupine quills;
in the fringed borders of their leggins and robes were
often fastened deer's hoofs, the spurs of wild turkeys,
or the claws of bears or eagles, which rattled as their
wearers walked along. Around their necks were strings
of beads, and their ears and noses were pierced for
the hanging of various other ornaments. In their hair,
the men tied eagle feathers, one for each scalp taken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>The "war bonnet," worn by the leading warriors,
was a headdress of skins and feathers, which
trailed down the back and often to the
ground, and was highly picturesque.
Add to this, the general habit of
tattooing, or, on ceremonial occasions,
of fantastically, often hideously,
painting the face and neck and breast
in blue, black, and red, and one can
well imagine that an Indian village, on
a f&ecirc;te day, or at other times of popular
excitement, presented a striking scene.</p>

<p>Each tribe could be readily distinguished
from others, by the shape and material of its
wigwams or huts. The Chippewas, for instance, lived
in hemispherical huts, covered with great sheets of
birch-bark; the Winnebago hut was more of the shape
of a sugar loaf, and was covered with mats of woven
rushes; the Sioux dwelt in cone-shaped huts (<i>tepees</i>),
covered with skins, the poles sticking out at the top.
These huts were foully kept, and all manner of camp
diseases prevailed; pulmonary complaints and rheumatism
were particularly frequent, and both men and
women looked old and haggard before they reached
middle age.</p>

<p>In the old mound building days, the huts of the village
leaders or chiefs were no doubt built upon the tops of
the mounds, while the common people lived on the
lower level. On top of a very large, conspicuous mound
was the council house, where important events were
discussed and action taken. Every warrior, that is,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
every man who had taken the scalp of an enemy, was
permitted to be heard around the council fire; but the
talking was for the most part done by the privileged
class of headmen, old men, wise men, and orators.</p>

<p>The political organization of the Indians was weak.
The villages were little democracies, where one warrior
considered himself as good as another, except for the
respect naturally due to the chiefs or headmen of the
several clans, or to those who had the reputation of
being wise and able. The sachem, or peace-chief, whose
office was hereditary through connection with his mother's
family, had but slight authority unless his natural
gifts commanded respect.</p>

<p>When war broke out, the fighting men ranged themselves
as volunteers under some popular leader, perhaps
a regular chief, or perhaps only a common warrior.
When the village council decided to do something, any
man might, if he wished, refuse to obey. It
was seldom that an entire tribe, consisting of
several villages, united in an important undertaking;
still more unusual was it, for several
tribes to unite. This was, of course, a weak
organization, such as a pure democracy is sure
to be. The Indian lacked self-control and
steadfastness of purpose, and the tribes and
villages were jealous of one another; so they
yielded before the whites, who better understood
the value of union in the face of a common
foe. The formidable conspiracies of King
Philip, Pontiac, and some others were the
work of Indians of quite unusual ability in<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
the art of organization; but the leaders could find few
others equal to their skill, and the uprisings were shortlived.</p>

<p>The Indian's strength as a fighter lay in his capacity
for stratagem, in his ability to thread the tangled forest
as silently and easily as the plain, and in his habit of
making rapid, unexpected sallies for robbery and murder,
and then gliding back into the dark and almost
impenetrable forest. He soon tired of long military
operations, and, when hard pressed, was apt to yield to
the white men who were often inferior in numbers, but
who soon learned to adopt the aborigine's skulking
method of warfare.</p>

<p>Lord of his own wigwam, and tyrannical over his
squaws, the Indian was kind and hospitable to unsuspected
strangers, yet merciless to a captive. Nevertheless,
prisoners were often snatched from the stake, or
the hands of a cruel captor, to be adopted into the family
of the rescuer, taking the place of some one killed by
the enemy. The red man was improvident, given to
gambling, and, despite the popular notion, was a jolly,
easy-going sort of fellow around his own fire; but in
council, and when among strangers, he was dignified
and reserved, too proud to exhibit curiosity or emotion.
He indulged in a style of oratory which abounded in
metaphors drawn from his observations of nature. He
was superstitious, peopling the elements with good and
bad spirits; and was much influenced by the medicine
men, who were half physicians and half priests, and
who commanded long fastings, penances, and sacrifices,
with curious dances, and various forms of necromancy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p>The Indian made tools and implements which were
well adapted to his purpose; the boats which he fashioned
of skins, of birch-bark, or of hollowed trunks of
trees have not been surpassed. He was remarkably
quick in learning the use of firearms, and soon equaled
the best white hunters as a marksman. A rude sense
of honor was developed within him; he had a nice perception
of what was proper to do; he knew how to
bend his own will to the force of custom, thus he overcame
to some extent the natural evils of democracy.
He understood the arts of politeness when he chose
to practice them. He could plan admirably, and often
displayed much skill in strategy; his reasoning was
good. He knew the value of form and color, as we
can see in his rock-carvings, in his rude paintings, in
the decorations on his leather, and in his often graceful
body-markings. In short, he was less of a savage
than we are in the habit of thinking him; he was
barbarous from choice, because he had a wild, untrammeled
nature and saw little in civilized ideas to
attract him. This is why, with his polite manner, he
always seemed to be yielding to missionary efforts,
yet perhaps never became thoroughly converted to
Christianity.</p>

<p>When first discovered by white men, Wisconsin Indians
were using rude pottery of their own make. Their
arrowheads and spearheads, axes, knives, and other
tools and weapons were of copper obtained from
Lake Superior mines, or of stone suitable for the
purpose. They smoked tobacco in pipes wrought in
curious shapes from a soft kind of stone found in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
Minnesota, and ornaments and charms were also frequently
made from this so-called "pipestone." Game
they killed with arrows or sling-shots, and in war
used these, as well as stone spears and hatchets and
stone-weighted clubs. The bulk
of their food they obtained by
hunting, fishing, and cultivating
the soil, although at times they
were forced to resort to the usually
plentiful supply of fruits,
nuts, and edible roots. Indian
corn was the principal crop.
Beans were sown in the same
hills, while sometimes between
the rows were planted several
varieties of pumpkins, water-melons, and sunflowers.
Tobacco and sweet potatoes were grown by some tribes,
but not in Wisconsin. In our State, wild rice (or oats)
furnished a good substitute for corn, and was similarly
cooked.</p>

</div>

<p>The whites wrought a serious change in the life and
manners of the Indians. They introduced firearms
among the savages, and induced them to become hunters,
and to wander far and wide for fur bearing animals,
the pelts of which were exchanged for European cloths,
glass beads, iron kettles, hatchets, spears, and guns and
powder. Thus the Indian soon lost the old arts of making
their own clothing from skins, kettles from clay,
weapons from stone and copper, and wampum (beads
used both for ornament and money) from clam shells.
It did not take them long to discover that their labor<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>
was more productive when they hunted, and purchased
what they wanted from the white traders, than when
they made their own rude implements and utensils and
raised crops. But the result was bad, for thereby they
ceased to be self-sustaining; their very existence became
dependent on the fur traders, who introduced among
them many vices, not least of which was a love for the
intoxicating liquors in which the traders dealt.</p>

<p>The Indian, at best, was never a lovable creature.
He was dirty, improvident, brutal; he was, as compared
with a European, mentally and morally but an undeveloped
man. He is to-day, as we find him upon the
reservations, pretty much the same as when found by
the French over two and a half centuries ago, except
that to his original vices he has added some of the
worst vices of the white man. The story of the Indian
is practically the story of the fur trade, and that is
the story of Wisconsin before it became a Territory.</p>

<h2 id="THE_DISCOVERY_OF_WISCONSIN">THE DISCOVERY OF WISCONSIN</h2>

<p>In the year 1608, the daring French explorer, Samuel
de Champlain, founded a settlement on the steep
cliff of Quebec, and thus laid the foundations for the
great colony of New France. This colony, in the course
of a century and a half, grew to embrace
all of what we now call Canada
and the entire basin of the Mississippi
River.</p>

<div>
<img src="images/image024.jpg" width="300" height="366" alt="" class="split" />
</div>

<p class="caption split">CHAMPLAIN</p>

<p>New France grew slowly. This was
largely owing to the opposition of the
fierce Iroquois Indians of New York,
whom Champlain had greatly angered.
Another reason was the changing moods
of the Algonkin Indians of Canada and
the Middle West; and still another, the enormous difficulties
of travel through the vast forests and along
streams frequently strewn with rapids. Champlain was
made governor of New France, and varied his duties
by taking long and painful journeys into the wilderness,
thus setting the fashion of extensive exploration.
There were two very good reasons for encouraging
explorers: in the first place, New France was then
largely controlled by a company of merchants, called<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
the Hundred Associates, who desired to push the fur
trade far and wide among the savage tribes; in the
second place, the French Catholic missionary priests
were anxious to reach the Indians, to convert them to
the Christian religion. Thus it came about that, during
the twenty-five years when the energetic and
enterprising Champlain was governor, there was little
talked or thought about in New France but exploration,
the fur trade, and the missions to the Indians.</p>

<p>In order to carry out his schemes for opening new
fields to the traders and missionaries, Champlain found
it necessary to train young men to this work. Only
those were selected for the task who had a fair education,
and were healthy, strong, well-formed, and brave.
They were, often when mere boys, sent far up into
the country to live among the Indian tribes, to be
adopted by them, to learn their habits and languages,
and to harden themselves to the rough life and rude diet
of the dusky dwellers in the forest. It took several
years of this practice, with patient suffering, for a youth
to become an expert who could be trusted to undergo
any hardship or daring task that might be asked of him.
It was one of these forest-bred interpreters who became
the first white discoverer of Wisconsin.</p>

<p>In those early days of New France, most of its people
were from the west and northwest provinces of France.
The crews of the ships which engaged in the trade to
New France were nearly all from the ports of Rouen,
Honfleur, F&eacute;camp, Cherbourg, Havre, Dieppe, and
Caen; in these north-coast cities lived the greater part
of the Hundred Associates, and from their vicinity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
came nearly all of the Jesuit missionaries and the young
men who were trained as interpreters.</p>

<p>Jean Nicolet was born in or near Cherbourg, and
was the son of a mail carrier. He was about twenty
years of age when, in 1618, he arrived in Quebec;
"and forasmuch as," says an old Jesuit writer of that
time, "his nature and excellent memory inspired good
hopes of him, he was sent to winter with the Island
Algonkins, in order to learn their language. He
tarried with them two years, alone of the French,
and always joined the Barbarians in their excursions
and journeys, undergoing such fatigues as none but
eyewitnesses can conceive; he often passed seven or
eight days without food, and once, full seven weeks with
no other nourishment than a little bark from the trees."
These "Island Algonkins" lived on Allumettes Island
in the Ottawa River, nearly three hundred miles from
Quebec; their language was the principal one then used
by the Indians in the country on the north bank of the
St. Lawrence and in the great valley of the Ottawa.</p>

<p>Although the life was so hard that few white men
could endure it, Nicolet, like most of the other interpreters,
learned to enjoy it; and, passing from one
tribe to another, in his search for new languages and
experiences, he remained among his forest friends for
eight or nine years. He had been with the Algonkins
for three or four years when he went, at the head of
four hundred of them, into the Iroquois country, and
made a treaty of peace with this savage foe, whom the
Algonkins always greatly feared. It is related that
thence he went to dwell with the Nipissing Indians, living<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
about Lake Nipissing, "where he passed for one
of that nation, taking part in the very frequent councils
of those tribes, having his own separate cabin and
household, and fishing and trading for himself."</p>

<p>Possibly Nicolet might have been recalled from the
woods before this, but, between 1629 and 1632, Canada
was in the hands of the British; and he remained
among the Indians, inspiring them to hostility
against the strangers. In 1632, when the country was
released to France, Champlain and his fellow-officers
returned to Quebec, and Nicolet was summoned thither,
and was employed as clerk and interpreter by the
Hundred Associates.</p>

<p>Champlain was eager to resume his explorations.
He had once been up the great Ottawa River, and
thence had crossed over to Lake Huron, and had become
keenly interested in what were then termed the
"upper waters." Of Lakes Ontario and Erie he knew
nothing, for the dreaded Iroquois had prevented the
French from going that way; and Lakes Superior and
Michigan were, as yet, undiscovered by whites. Vague
rumors of these unknown regions had been brought to
Quebec by bands of strange savages who had found
their way down to the French settlements in search
of European goods in exchange for furs.</p>

<p>Among the many queer stories brought by these
fierce, painted barbarians was one which told of a
certain "Tribe of the Sea" dwelling far away on
the western banks of the "upper waters," a people
who had come out of the West, no man knew whence.
In those early days, Europeans still clung to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
notion which Columbus had always held, that
America was but an eastern projection of Asia. This
is the reason that our savages were called Indians,
for the discoverers of America thought they had
merely reached an outlying portion of India; they
had no idea that this was a great and new continent.
Governor Champlain, and after him Governor Frontenac,
and the great explorer La Salle, all supposed
that they could reach India and China, already known
to travelers to the east, by persistently going westward.
When, therefore, Champlain heard of these strange
Men of the Sea, he at once declared they must be the
long-sought Chinese. He engaged Nicolet, in whom
he had great confidence, to go out and find them, wherever
they were, make a treaty of peace with them, and
secure their trade.</p>

<p>Upon the first day of July, 1634, Nicolet left Quebec,
a passenger in the second of two fleets of canoes containing
Indians from the Ottawa valley, who had come
down to the white settlements to trade. Among his
fellow passengers were three adventurous Jesuit missionaries,
who were on their way to the country of the
Huron tribe, east of Lake Huron. Leaving the priests
at Allumettes Island, he continued up the Ottawa,
then crossed over to Lake Nipissing, visited old friends
among the Indians there, and descended French Creek,
which flows from Lake Nipissing into Georgian Bay, a
northeastern arm of Lake Huron. On the shores of
the great lake, he engaged seven Hurons to paddle
his long birch-bark canoe and guide him to the mysterious
"Tribe of the Sea."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>Slowly they felt their way along the northern shores
of Lake Huron, where the pine forests sweep majestically
down to the water's edge, or crown the bold
cliffs, while southward the green waters of the inland
sea stretch away to the horizon. Storms too severe
for their frail craft frequently detained them on the
shore, and daily they sought food in the forest. The
savage crew, tiring of exertion, and overcome by superstitious
fears, would fain have abandoned the voyage;
but the strong, energetic master bore down all opposition.
At last they reached the outlet of Lake Superior,
the forest-girt Strait of St. Mary, and paddled up as
far as the falls, the Sault Ste. Marie, as it came to be
called by the Jesuit missionaries. Here there was a
large village of Algonkins, where the explorer tarried,
refreshing his crew and gathering information concerning
the "Tribe of the Sea." The explorers do not
appear to have visited Lake Superior; but, bolder
than before, they set forth to the southwest, and passing
gayly through the island-dotted Straits of Mackinac,
now one of the greatest of the world's highways,
were soon upon the broad waters of Lake Michigan,
of which Nicolet was probably the first white discoverer.</p>

<p>Clinging still to the northern shore, camping in the
dense woods at night or when threatened by storm,
Nicolet rounded far-stretching Point Detour and landed
upon the shores of Bay de Noquet, a northern arm of
Green Bay. Another Algonkin tribe dwelt here, with
whom the persistent explorer smoked the pipe of peace,
and they gave him further news of the people he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
sought. Next he stopped at the mouth of the Menominee
River, now the northeast boundary between Wisconsin
and Michigan, where the Menominee tribe lived.
Another council was held, more tobacco was smoked,
and one of Nicolet's Huron companions was sent forward
to notify the Winnebagoes at the mouth of the
Fox River that the great white chief was approaching;
for the uncouth Winnebagoes were the far-famed
"Tribe of the Sea" whom Nicolet had traveled so far
to find.</p>

<p>The manner of their obtaining this name, which had
so misled Champlain, is curious. The word was originally
"ouinepeg," or "ouinepego," and both Winnipeg
and Winnebago are derived from it. Now "ouinepeg"
was an Algonkin term meaning "men of (or from) the
fetid (or bad-smelling) water." Possibly the tribe, far
back in their history, once dwelt by a strong-smelling
sulphur spring. The French, in their eagerness to find
China, fancied that the fetid water must necessarily be
salt water, hence the Western Ocean or "China Sea;"
that is why they called the Winnebagoes the "Tribe
of the Sea," and jumped at the conclusion that they
were Chinese.</p>

<p>By this time, Nicolet had his doubts about meeting
Chinese at Green Bay. As, however, he had brought
with him "a grand robe of China damask, all strewn
with flowers, and birds of many colors," such as
Chinese mandarins are supposed to wear, he put it
on; and when he landed on the shore of Fox River,
where is now the city of Green Bay, strode forward
into the group of waiting, skin-clad savages, discharging<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
the pistols which he held in either hand. Women
and children fled in terror to the wigwams; and the
warriors fell down and worshiped this Manitou (or
spirit) who carried with him thunder and lightning.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/image031.jpg" width="600" height="453" alt="" />
</div>

<p>"The news of his coming," says the old Jesuit chronicler,
"quickly spread to the places round about, and
there assembled four or five thousand men. Each of
the Chief men made a feast for him, and at one of
these banquets they served at least six-score Beavers."
There was a great deal of oratory at these feasts, with
the exchange of belts of wampum, and the smoking
of pipes of peace, and no end of assurances on the
part of the red men that they were glad to become the
friends of New France and to keep the peace with
the great French father at Paris.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>Leaving his new friends at Green Bay, the explorer
ascended the Fox River as far as the Mascoutins, who
had a village upon a prairie ridge, near where Berlin
now lies. He made a similar treaty with this people,
and learned of the Wisconsin River which flows into
the Mississippi, but did not go to seek it. He then
walked overland to the tribe of the Illinois, probably
returning to Quebec, in 1635, by way of Lake Michigan.
Nicolet had proceeded over nearly two thousand
five hundred miles of lake, river, forest, and prairie;
had been subjected to a thousand dangers from man
and beast, as well as from fierce rapids and stormtossed
waters; had made treaties with several heretofore
unknown tribes, and had widely extended the
boundaries of New France.</p>

<p>For various reasons, it was nearly thirty years before
another visit was made by white men to Wisconsin.
Nicolet himself soon settled down at the new town of
Three Rivers, on the shores of the St. Lawrence, between
Quebec and Montreal, as the agent and interpreter
there of the great fur trade company. He was
a very useful man both to the company and to the
missionaries; for he had great influence over the
Indians, who loved him sincerely, and he always exercised
this influence for the good of the colony and of
religion. He was drowned in the month of October,
1642, while on his way to release a poor savage prisoner
who was being maltreated by Indians in the neighborhood.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<h2 id="RADISSON_AND_GROSEILLIERS">RADISSON AND GROSEILLIERS</h2>

<p>In the preceding chapter, the story was told how,
in the year 1634, only fourteen years after the
Pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock, Jean Nicolet was
sent by Governor Champlain, of Quebec, all the way
out to Wisconsin, to make friends with our Indians,
and to induce them to trade at the French villages
on the lower St. Lawrence River. Whether any of
them did, as a result of this visit, go down to see the
palefaces at Three Rivers or Quebec, and carry furs
to exchange for European beads, hatchets, guns, and
iron kettles, we do not know; there is no record of their
having done so, neither are we aware that any white
man soon followed Nicolet to Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Fur traders were in the habit of wandering far into
the woods, and meeting strange tribes of Indians; sometimes
they would not return to Quebec until after years
of absence, and then would bring with them many
canoe-loads of skins. The fur trade was under the
control of the Company of the Hundred Associates.
The laws of New France declared that there could be
no traffic with the Indians, except what this great company
approved; for they had bought from the king of
France the right to do all the trading and make all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
the profits, and New France really existed only to make
money for these rich Associates. The fur trade laws
provided severe punishments for those violating them;
nevertheless, although the population was small, and
everybody knew everybody else in the whole country,
there were many brave, daring men who traveled through
the deep forests, traded with the Indians on their own
account, and paid no license fees to the Associates.
These men, whom an oppressive monopoly could not
keep down, were the most venturesome explorers in all
this vast region; they were known as <i>coureurs des bois</i>,
or "wood rangers." La Salle, Duluth, Perrot, and
many other early Western explorers, were, at times in
their career, <i>coureurs des bois</i>.</p>

<p>Now, as a <i>coureur de bois</i> was an outlaw, because
he wandered and traded without a license, naturally he
was not in the habit of telling where he had been or
what he had seen; then again, though brave men, few
of these outlaws were educated, hence they seldom
wrote journals of their travels. For these reasons,
we are often obliged to depend on chance references
to them, in the writings of others, and to patch up our
evidence as to their movements, out of many stray
fragments of information.</p>

<p>So far as we at present know, there were no white
men in Wisconsin during the twenty years following
the coming of Nicolet. It is uncertain when the next
white men came upon our soil, but there is good reason
to believe that it was in the autumn of 1654. These
men were Pierre-Esprit Radisson and M&eacute;dard Chouart
des Groseilliers. Like so many others in New France,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
they were from the northern part of old France, and
came to Canada while yet lads, Groseilliers in 1641,
and Radisson ten years later. In 1653, Groseilliers
married a sister of Radisson, and after that the two
men became inseparable companions in their long and
romantic wanderings.</p>

<p>They experienced a number of thrilling adventures
with Indians, both as traders to the forest camps of
savages friendly to New France, and as prisoners in
the hands of the French-hating Iroquois of New York.
Nevertheless they had grown accustomed to the hard,
perilous life of the wilderness, and were thoroughly in
love with it. It was, as near as we can ascertain, early
in the month of August, 1654, when these two adventurers
started out "to discover the great lakes that they
heard the wild men speak of." They followed, most
of the way, in the footsteps of Nicolet, up the Ottawa
River, and by the way of Lake Nipissing and French
River to Georgian Bay of Lake Huron. This had now
become a familiar route to the fur traders and Jesuit
missionaries; but of the country west of the eastern
shore of Lake Huron scarcely anything was yet known,
except what vague and often fanciful reports of it
were brought by the savages.</p>

<p>Like Nicolet, our two adventurous explorers traveled
by canoes, with Indians to do the paddling. Passing
between the Manitoulin Islands, in the northern waters
of Lake Huron, they visited and traded with the Huron
Indians there, thence proceeded through the Straits of
Mackinac, and across to the peninsula of Door county,
which separates Green Bay from Lake Michigan. Here<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
they spent the winter with the Pottawattomies; they held
great feasts with them, at which dogs and beavers, boiled
in kettles into a sort of thick soup, were the greatest delicacies;
they smoked pipes of peace with them, at wordy
councils which often lasted through several days; they
hunted and fished with them, in a spirit of good fellowship;
and, in general, they shared
the fortunes of their forest
friends, whether feasting
or starving, after the
manner of all these
early French explorers
and fur traders.
In the curious journal
afterward written
in wretched but picturesque
English by
Radisson, he says,
"We weare every
where much made of;
neither wanted victualls,
for all the different
nations that we
mett conducted us &amp;
furnished us with all necessaries."</p>

<p>Springtime (1655) came at last, and the two traders
proceeded merrily up the Fox River, still in the wake
of Nicolet, past the sites of the present cities of Green
Bay, De Pere, Kaukauna, Appleton, Neenah, and Menasha.
They frequently had to carry their boats around
the rapids and waterfalls, but after passing Doty's Island<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
they had a smooth highway. Paddling through Lake
Winnebago, and past the site of Oshkosh, then an
Indian village, they pushed on through the winding
reaches of the Upper Fox, and at last came to a broad
prairie near Berlin, whereon was stationed the village
of the Mascoutins, or Fire Nation.</p>

<p>The Mascoutins treated the strangers, as they had
Nicolet, with great kindness. With this village as
headquarters, the explorers made frequent expeditions,
"anxious to be knowne with the remotest people."
Radisson quaintly writes, "We ware 4 moneths in our
voyage without doeing any thing but goe from river
to river." The explorers cared little, we may suppose,
except to have a good time and make a profitable
trade with the Indians; they do not appear to have
made any map. Writing about their travels, many
years after, Radisson says, in one place, that they went
into a "great river" which flowed southward, and journeyed
to a land of continual warmth, finer than Italy,
where he heard the Indians describe certain white men
living to the south, who might be Spaniards. It is
supposed by many historians that Radisson meant that
he was on the Mississippi; if this supposition be true,
then the two explorers undoubtedly found the great
river by going up the Fox from the Mascoutin village,
carrying their canoe over the mile and a half of
intervening marsh at Portage, and gliding down the
Wisconsin to its junction with the Mississippi at Prairie
du Chien. This is important, for the credit of discovering
the Upper Mississippi is usually given to Louis
Joliet and Father Marquette, who took this very course<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
in 1673, eighteen years later. But the whole question
of what "great river" Radisson meant to describe is
so involved in doubt, that very likely we shall never
know the truth about it.</p>

<p>Leaving their Mascoutin friends at last, apparently
in the autumn of 1655, the two adventurers returned
down the Fox River to Green Bay; thence on to the
large villages of Indians which clustered around the
Sault Ste. Marie. Received there, as elsewhere, with
much feasting and good will, Radisson and Groseilliers
conducted trade with their hosts, and explored a long
stretch of the southern coast of Lake Superior, but do
not appear to have ventured so far as the Pictured
Rocks. They also made long expeditions into the
country, on snowshoes, to visit and trade with other
tribes in the Michigan Peninsula and northern Wisconsin,
and even as far off as Hudson Bay, at one
time being accompanied by a hundred and fifty Indian
hunters.</p>

<p>In this wild fashion they spent the winter of 1655-56,
and finally reached Quebec in August, 1656. They had
been absent from home for two years, and had experienced
many singular adventures. It happened that
during their absence the Iroquois had succeeded in
keeping the Hurons and other friendly Indians from
visiting Quebec, so that the fur trade, upon which New
France depended, was now quite ruined; for this reason
the arrival of Radisson and Groseilliers, with a great
store of furs from far-away Wisconsin and Lake
Superior, was hailed as a joyful event, and, despite
their having departed without a license, they were made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
welcome at Quebec, the cannons being fired and
the people flocking on the beach to meet them.</p>

<p>Men who love adventure cannot
be kept out of it long, whatever
the risk. Three years
later, in the summer of
1659, Radisson and
Groseilliers again
set off for Lake
Superior, up the
old Ottawa and
Georgian Bay
routes. This time
they were specially
bidden by
the king's officers
at Quebec
not to go, so that
they were obliged to
slip off secretly, and
join a fleet of Indian
canoes returning home after the
annual trade at the French settlements.</p>

<p>At Sault Ste. Marie they spent a short time with their
savage friends, and then paddled westward, along the
southern shore of Lake Superior. In their company
were several Huron and Ottawa Indians, who had
recently been compelled to flee to Wisconsin because
of Iroquois raids, which now extended as far west as
Michigan. The travelers were obliged to carry their
boats across Keweenaw Point, and at last found their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
way to Chequamegon Bay, a noble sheet of water,
hemmed in by the beautiful Apostle Islands, and to-day
a popular summer resort.</p>

<p>Not far to the west of where Ashland now lies,
somewhere near Whittlesey's Creek, they built for
themselves a rude hut, or fort, of logs. The place was
a small point of land jutting out into the water, a
triangle, Radisson describes it, with water on two sides
and land at the base. The land side of the triangle was
guarded with a palisade of pointed stakes, and to prevent
surprises by night, for Indians were always prowling
about looking for plunder, the traders surrounded
their house with boughs of trees piled one upon the
other, intertwined with a long cord hung with little bells.</p>

<p>After staying at their fort for a few weeks, they
managed to <i>cache</i> (secretly bury) the greater part of
their goods; and then set out on a hunt with their
Huron neighbors upon the headwaters of the Chippewa
River. Unusually severe weather set in, and a famine
ensued, for there was no game to kill, and the snow
was so deep that they could hardly travel.</p>

<p>In the following spring (1660) the Frenchmen went
with their Hurons on a long search for provisions, getting
as far west as the Sioux camps in northern Minnesota.
Then they returned to Chequamegon Bay,
where they built another little fort, and from which
they visited some Indians on the northwest shore of
Lake Superior. In August they returned home, again
in a fleet of Huron canoes going down to Montreal to
trade. But this time the officers of the colony punished
them for being <i>coureurs des bois</i>, and confiscated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
most of their valuable furs, which meant the loss of
nearly all the property they possessed.</p>

<p>Angered at this treatment, Groseilliers went to Paris
to seek justice from the king; but, obtaining none,
he and Radisson offered their services to the English,
whom they told of Hudson Bay and its great furtrading
possibilities. It took several years, however,
for negotiations to be completed; and it was while in
London that Radisson, for the information of the
English king, wrote his now famous journal of explorations
in the Lake Superior country. Finally,
after some unfortunate voyages, our explorers, in 1669,
reached Hudson Bay in an English ship; and, as a
result, there was formed in England the great Hudson
Bay Company, which from that day to this has
controlled the rich fur trade of those northern waters.</p>

</div>

<p>In later years (1678), we find Radisson and Groseilliers,
who had been pardoned by Louis XIV., king of
France, for their desertion to the English, back again
in Paris. But after a time, suspicions as to their loyalty
spread abroad, and they again joined the English,
to whom they were useful in attracting Indian trade
away from the French to the Hudson Bay Company.
They died at last, in London, considered by the French
as traitors to their own country. They will, however,
live in history as daring explorers, who opened to
the fur trade the country now known as Wisconsin,
the waters of Lake Superior, and the vast region of
Hudson Bay.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<h2 id="THE_STORY_OF_JOLIET_AND_MARQUETTE">THE STORY OF JOLIET AND MARQUETTE</h2>

<p>In history there are two "discoveries of the Mississippi";
the lower waters were discovered by the
Spanish explorer, De Soto (April, 1541); and the upper
waters, by Frenchmen from Canada or New France.
Nothing came of De Soto's discovery for over a hundred
years, for the Spaniards had no love for exploration
that gave no promise of mines of precious
metals, and it is to the French that we give chief credit
for finding the Mississippi; for their discovery immediately
led the way to a general knowledge of the
geography and the savages of the great valley, and
to settlements there by whites.</p>

<p>It is seldom safe to say who was the first man to
discover anything, be it in geography, in science, or
in the arts; generally, we can tell only who it was
that made the first record of the discovery. Now
it is quite possible that Frenchmen may have wandered
into the Upper Mississippi valley before Radisson
and Groseilliers appeared in Wisconsin (1654);
but, if they did, we do not know of it. It is still
a matter of dispute whether the "great river" described
in Radisson's journal was the Mississippi;
some writers think that it was, and that to him and to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
Groseilliers belongs the honor of the first-recorded discovery.
Then, again, there are some who think that
in 1670 the famous fur trader La Salle was upon the
Mississippi; but that is a mere guess, and honors
cannot be awarded upon guesswork. We do know,
however, that in 1673 Joliet and Marquette set out
for the very purpose of finding the Mississippi, and
succeeded; and that upon their return they wrote
reports of their trip and made maps of the country.
Having thus opened the door, as it were, white men
were thereafter frequent travelers on the broad waterway.
Hence it is idle to discuss possible previous
visits; to Joliet and Marquette are due the credit of
regular, premeditated discovery.</p>

<p>Louis Joliet, who led this celebrated expedition, was
at the time but twenty-eight years old. He was born
in Quebec, had been educated at the Jesuit college
there, and early in life became a fur trader. He
learned several Indian languages, and made numerous
long journeys into the wilderness, and, like Jean Nicolet
before him, was regarded by the officers and the
missionaries at Quebec as a man well fitted for the
life of an explorer. In 1671 he went with Saint
Lusson, one of the officials of New France, to Sault
Ste. Marie. St. Lusson made peace with the Indians
of the Northwest, and, in the name of the king of
France, took possession of all the country bordering
on the upper Great Lakes.</p>

<p>Upon returning to Quebec, Joliet met the famous
Count Frontenac, but recently arrived from Paris,
where he had been appointed as governor of New<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
France. Frontenac was curious to know more about
the Mississippi River, especially whether it flowed into
the Pacific Ocean, or the "Southern Sea" as it was then
called in Europe. In looking about for a man to head
an expedition to the great river, he could hear of no
one better prepared for such service than Joliet.</p>

<p>In those early days, no exploring
party was complete without a priest;
the conversion of the savages to
Christianity was quite as important,
in the eyes of the king, as
the development
of the fur trade.
Father Jacques
Marquette, then
thirty-six years of
age, was the Jesuit
missionary at Point
St. Ignace, on the
Straits of Mackinac.
When Joliet reached that
outpost, after a long and
weary canoe voyage up the now
familiar Ottawa River and Georgian
Bay route, he delivered orders to Marquette
to join his party. Joliet was a favorite with his
old instructors, the Jesuits, so that the two young men
were well pleased with being united upon this project,
Joliet to attend to the worldly affairs of the expedition,
and Marquette to the religious. Both of them
had had long training in the hard life of the wilderness,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
and understood Indian character and habits as
well as any men in New France.</p>

<p>It was upon the 17th of May, 1673, that the two
explorers, in high spirits, set forth from Marquette's
little mission at Point Ignace. Five French boatmen
paddled their two canoes, and did most of the heavy
work of the journey, carrying the boats and cargoes
around rapids, or along portage trails from one river to
another. Marquette says in his journal: "Our joy at
being chosen for this expedition roused our courage,
and sweetened the labor of paddling from morning to
night."</p>

<p>The course they took was, no doubt, that followed
through nearly two hundred years thereafter by persons
journeying in canoes from Mackinac to Green
Bay. They paddled along the northern shores of Lake
Michigan and Green Bay, until they could cross over
through the stormy water known as "Death's Door,"
to the islands beyond the Door county peninsula; and
then crept down the east shore of Green Bay, under
the lee of the high banks.</p>

<p>They seem to have made good time, for on the 7th of
June they reached the village of the Mascoutins, on
the south shore of Fox River, near where Berlin now
is, the same village, it will be remembered, where Nicolet,
Radisson, and Allouez had already been entertained.
We do not know upon what day our two
explorers had reached De Pere, where the Jesuit
mission was established, but they probably stayed
among their friends there for some days, before going
up the Fox.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>In his journal, the good missionary described nearly
everything he saw, with much detail. The Menominee
Indians interested him greatly; he calls them "the
People of the Wild Oats," and tells how they gather
the grain of these wild oats (or wild rice), by "shaking
the ears, on their right and left, into the canoe as they
advance" through the swamps. Then they take the
grain to the land, strip it of much of the chaff, and
"dry it in the smoke on a wooden lattice, under which
they keep up a small fire for several days. When
the oats are well dried, they put them in a skin of
the form of a bag, which is then forced into a hole
made on purpose in the ground; then they tread it
out, so long and so well, that the grain being freed
from the chaff is easily winnowed; after which they
reduce it to meal." There are still to be seen, on the
shores of Lake Koshkonong, and several other Wisconsin
lakes and rivers, the shallow, bowl-like holes
used by the Indians in threshing this grain, as described
by Marquette two and a quarter centuries ago.</p>

<p>The Mascoutin village also claims much attention in
the missionary's diary. The Mascoutins themselves
are rude, he says; so also are the Kickapoos, many of
whom live with them. At this village are also many
Miami Indians, who had fled from their homes in
Indiana and Ohio, through fear of the fierce Iroquois
of New York. These Miamis are, Marquette tells
us, superior to the Wisconsin Indians, being "more
civil, liberal, and better made; they wear two long
earlocks, which give them a good appearance," and
are brave, docile, and devout, listening carefully to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
missionaries who have visited them. The Father also
describes the site of the village: "I felt no little
pleasure in beholding the position of this town; the
view is beautiful and very picturesque, for from the
eminence on which it is perched, the eye discovers on
every side prairies spreading away beyond its reach,
interspersed with thickets or groves of lofty trees.
The soil is very good, producing much corn; the
Indians gather also quantities of plums and grapes,
from which good wine could be made, if they chose.
As bark for cabins is rare in this country, they use
rushes, which serve them for walls and roof, but which
are no great shelter against the wind, and still less
against the rain when it falls in torrents. The advantage
of this kind of cabins is that they can roll
them up, and carry them easily where they like in
hunting-time."</p>

</div>

<p>Above the Mascoutin village, the Fox begins to
narrow, being hemmed in, and often choked, by broad
swamps of reeds and wild oats. The canoe traveler
who does not know the channel, is sometimes in danger
of missing it, and getting entangled in the maze of
bayous. Two Miami guides were therefore obtained
from their hosts, and on the 10th of June the travelers
set off for the southwest, "in the sight of a great
crowd, who could not wonder enough to see seven
Frenchmen alone in two canoes, dare to undertake so
strange and so hazardous an expedition." The guides
safely conducted them to the place where is now situated
the city of Portage, helped them over the swampy
plain of a mile and a half in width, and, after seeing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
them embarked upon the broad waters of the Wisconsin
River, left them "alone in an unknown country,
in the hands of Providence."</p>

<p>The broad valley of the Wisconsin presents a far
different appearance from that of the peacefully flowing
Upper Fox, with its outlying marshes of reeds, and
its numerous lakes. The Wisconsin, or Meskousing,
as Marquette writes it, is flanked by ranges of bold,
heavily wooded bluffs, which are furrowed with romantic
ravines, while the channel is, at low water, studded
with islands and sand bars, and in times of flood
spreads to a great width. Marquette himself describes
it thus: "It is very broad, with a sandy bottom,
forming many shallows, which render navigation very
difficult. It is full of vine-clad islets. On the banks
appear fertile lands diversified with wood, prairie, and
hill. Here you find oaks, walnut, whitewood, and another
kind of tree with branches armed with long
thorns. We saw no small game or fish, but deer and
moose in considerable numbers." About ninety miles
below Portage, they thought that they discovered an
iron mine.</p>

<p>At last, on the 17th of June, they swiftly glided
through the picturesque delta of the Wisconsin, near
Prairie du Chien, and found themselves upon the
Mississippi, grateful that after so long and tiresome a
journey they had found the object of their search.
Joliet's instructions were, however, to ascertain whether
the great stream flowed into the "Southern Sea"; so
they journeyed as far down as the mouth of the
Arkansas. There they gathered information from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
the Indians which led them to believe that the river
emptied into the Gulf of Mexico; thus the old riddle
of the supposed waterway through the heart of the
North American continent was left unsolved.</p>

<div>

<p>In returning, Joliet and Marquette came up the Illinois
River, and reached Lake Michigan by portaging
over to the Chicago River. They were back at the
Jesuit mission at De Pere, in September. Marquette
having fallen ill, Joliet was obliged to return to Quebec
alone, leaving the missionary to spend the winter with
his Wisconsin friends. When almost within sight of
the French settlement at Montreal, at the mouth of the
Ottawa River, poor Joliet lost all his papers in the dangerous
Lachine rapids, and could make only a verbal
report to the government. He later prepared a map
of his route, with great care, and forwarded that to
France; it is one of the best maps of the interior parts
of North America made in the seventeenth century.
Joliet, as the leader of the expedition, had hoped to
receive, either in office or lands, substantial rewards
for his great discoveries; but there were now new
officials at Quebec, with whom he had little influence,
and the recompense of this brave spirit was small.
Others reaped what advantages there were in the opening
of the Mississippi valley to the fur trade.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the unworldly priest who was his
friend and companion, and who neither desired nor
needed special recognition for what he had done, has,
all unconsciously, won most of the glory of this brilliant
enterprise. Under the rules of the Jesuit order,
each missionary in New France was obliged to forward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
to his superior at Quebec, once each year, a written
journal of his doings. Marquette prepared his report
at leisure during the winter, while at De Pere, and in
the spring sent it down to Quebec, by an Indian who
was going thither to trade with the whites. Accompanying
it was a crudely drawn but fairly accurate map
of the Mississippi basin. The journal and map arrived
safely, but for some reason neither
was then printed; indeed,
they remained almost unknown
to the world for a hundred and
seventy-nine years, being at last
published in 1852. Marquette
never learned the fate of either
Joliet's elaborate records or his
own simple story of the expedition,
for he died in May, 1675,
on the eastern shore of Lake
Michigan, worn out by disease
and by excessive labors in behalf
of the Indians.</p>

<p>By the time Marquette's journal
was finally published, Joliet
had been well-nigh forgotten;
and to Marquette, because his journal was the only one
printed, is given the chief credit in nearly every American
history. The legislature of Wisconsin has placed
a beautiful marble statue of the gentle Marquette, as
the discoverer of the Mississippi, in the capitol in
Washington; whereas the name of his sturdy chief is
perpetuated only in the principal prison city of Illinois.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<h2 id="THE_JESUIT_MISSIONARIES">THE JESUIT MISSIONARIES</h2>

<p>In planting settlements in Canada (or New France,
as it was then called), the French had two principal
objects in view: the fur trade with the Indians, and
the conversion of these Indians to the Christian religion.
Roman Catholic missionaries from France therefore
accompanied the first settlers, and were always
prominent in the affairs of the colony. Governor
Champlain brought to Quebec some missionaries of
the Recollect order, a branch of the Franciscans; but
after a few years, the difficulties of their task proved
so great that the Recollects asked the Jesuits, a much
stronger order, to come over and help them. It was
not long before nearly all the Franciscans returned
home, and the Jesuits were practically the only missionaries
in New France.</p>

<p>During the first few years, these missionaries spent
their winters in Quebec, ministering to the colonists,
and each spring went out to meet the Indians in their
summer camps. It was soon found, however, that
greater persistence was needed; and after that, instead
of returning home in the autumn, they followed the
savages upon their winter hunts. In order to convert
the Indians, the missionaries studied their many languages,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
their habits, and their manner of thought,
lived as they lived, and with them often suffered untold
misery, for life in a savage camp is sometimes
almost unbearable to educated and refined white men,
such as the French Jesuits were. They did not succeed
in winning over to Christianity many of their savage
companions; indeed, the latter frequently treated
them with great cruelty, and several of the missionaries
were tortured to death.</p>

<p>Such were the ignorance and superstition of the
Indians, that every disaster which happened to them,
poor luck in hunting, famine, accident, or disease, was
attributed to the "black gowns," as the Jesuits were
called because of their long black cassocks. When
the missionaries were performing the rites of their
church, baptizing children or sick people, or saying
mass, it was thought by these simple barbarians that
they were practicing magic for the destruction of the
red men. Thus the Jesuits, during the hundred years
or more which they spent in traveling far and near
through the forests of New France, seeking new tribes
to convert, while still laboring with those already
known, were in a state of perpetual martyrdom for
the cause of Christianity. No soldier has ever performed
greater acts of heroism than these devoted disciples
of the cross. Several of the best and bravest
of them were among the pioneers of the Wisconsin
wilderness.</p>

<p>The first Jesuit missionary to come to Wisconsin was
Father Ren&eacute; M&eacute;nard (pr. <i>Ray-nay' May-nar'</i>). He had
sailed from France to Canada in the year 1640, when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
he was thirty-five years old, and on his arrival was sent
to the savages east of Lake Huron, among whom he
labored and suffered for eight years. Later, he went to
the Iroquois, in New York, and at last had to fly for
his life, on account of an Indian plot to murder all the
French missionaries in that country. He was for some
time the superior of his order, at the Three Rivers
mission, on the St. Lawrence, halfway between Quebec
and Montreal, and in the early autumn of 1660
was summoned to go to Lake Superior, which had
been made known through the explorations of Radisson
and Groseilliers.</p>

<p>These brave adventurers had returned from their
second voyage into the Northwest, accompanied by a
fleet of Indian canoes; several of the canoes were
manned by Hurons from the Black River, who had
come down all the way to Montreal to trade their furs
for European goods. The red men spent some ten
days there, feasting with the fur trade agents, and
about the first of September set out on their return.
With them were M&eacute;nard, his servant, and seven other
Frenchmen.</p>

<p>M&eacute;nard was now only fifty-five years old, but so
severe had been his life among the Indians, that his
hair was white, he was covered with the scars of
wounds, and "his form was bent as with great age."
The long journey was therefore a severe strain upon
the good man, for in addition to the exposure to
weather, he was forced to paddle most of the time, to
carry heavy packs over the numerous portage trails,
and to suffer many indignities at the hands of his hosts.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
By the time the company had finally made their weary
way up the Ottawa River, over to Georgian Bay, and
through to Sault Ste. Marie, the missionary was in a
deplorable condition. An accident happened to his
canoe, and the Frenchmen
and three Indians
were abandoned on
the south shore of
Lake Superior, at Keweenaw
Bay. There
he was forced to
spend the winter in a squalid
Ottawa village, and nearly lost
his life in a famine which overtook
the natives of that region.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1661, while at
Keweenaw Bay, M&eacute;nard received an
invitation to visit a band of poor, starving
Hurons at the headwaters of the Black River.
Several of these Indians had been baptized by Jesuits
before the Iroquois had driven them out from their old
home to the east of Lake Huron. In spite of his weak
condition, and the many perils of this journey of a
hundred and fifty miles through the dense forest, the
aged missionary bade farewell to the Keweenaw Ottawas,
among whom had also wintered several French
fur traders, and in July set out to obey the new summons.
In his company were his servant and several
Hurons who had come to trade with the Ottawas.</p>

<p>They proceeded along the narrow trail which ran
from Keweenaw Bay to Lake Vieux D&eacute;sert, the headwaters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
of the Wisconsin River, but the feeble missionary's
gait was too slow for the Indians, who, after the
manner of their kind, promptly deserted their white
friends, leaving them to follow and obtain food as best
they might. At the lake the Frenchmen embarked in
a canoe upon the south-flowing Wisconsin, and paddled
down as far as Bill Cross Rapids, some five or six miles
above the mouth of Copper River, and not far from
where is now the city of Merrill. From the foot of
these rapids, they had intended leaving their canoe, and
following a trail which led off westward through the
woods to the headwaters of the Black, near the present
town of Chelsea. M&eacute;nard's servant took the canoe
through the rapids, while the missionary, as usual, to
lighten the boat, walked along the portage trail. He
must have lost his way and perished of exposure in
the depths of the dark and tangled forest, for his
servant could not find any trace of him. Thus closed
the career of Wisconsin's pioneer missionary, who died
in the pursuit of duty, as might a soldier upon the field
of battle.</p>

<p>The death of M&eacute;nard left the Lake Superior country
without a missionary; but four years later (1665),
another Jesuit was sent thither in the person of Claude
Allouez (pr. <i>Al-loo-ay'</i>), who chose Chequamegon Bay
for the seat of his labors. There he found a squalid
village, near Radisson and Groseilliers' old forts, on the
southwest shore; it was composed of remnants of eight
or ten tribes, some of whom had been driven westward
by the Iroquois and others eastward by the Sioux. He
called his mission La Pointe, from the neighboring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
long point of land which, projecting northward, divides
Chequamegon Bay from Lake Superior.</p>

<p>Allouez could make little impression upon these
poor savages. After four years of hard service and
ill-treatment, he was relieved by Jacques Marquette,
a youthful and enthusiastic priest. Late in the autumn
of 1669, Allouez went to Fox River, and there he
founded the mission of St. Francis Xavier, overlooking
the rapids of De Pere.<a id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
This was a more successful
mission than the one
at Chequamegon Bay;
for, during the next summer,
the western
Sioux furiously attacked
the Indian
neighbors of Marquette
and sent them all
flying eastward, like dry
leaves before an October gale. The zealous Marquette
accompanied them, and, with such bands as he could
induce to settle around him, opened a new mission
on the mainland near Mackinac Island, at the Point
St. Ignace of to-day.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Allouez continued his mission at De Pere,
making long trips throughout Wisconsin, preaching to
the Indians, and establishing the mission of St. Mark
on the Wolf River, probably on or near Lake Shawano,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>where the Chippewas then lived in great numbers.
Later, he opened St. James mission at the Mascoutin
village near Berlin. His churches were mere huts or
wigwams built of reeds and bark, after the manner of
the natives. Another Jesuit, Louis Andr&eacute;, was sent
to Wisconsin to assist this enterprising missionary, and
they traveled among the tribes, preaching and healing
the sick in nearly every Indian village in the wide
country between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi.
The career of these good missionaries was not one of
ease. Their lives were frequently in peril; they suffered
severely from cruel treatment, hunger, cold, and
the many hardships of forest travel; and were rewarded
by few conversions.</p>

</div>

<div>
<img src="images/image058.jpg" width="300" height="627" class="splitr" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Allouez remained in Wisconsin until 1676, when he
departed to carry on a similar work in Illinois, dying
thirteen years later, after a score of years spent in
Western missions. In Wisconsin, he was succeeded,
in turn, by several others of his order; chief among
them were Fathers Silvy, Albanel, Nouvel, Enjalran,
and Chardon. Chardon was the last of his kind, for
he, with other Frenchmen, was driven out of Wisconsin
in 1728, at the time of the Fox War.</p>

<p>It was during the time of Enjalran, at De Pere, that
Nicolas Perrot, a famous fur trader, was military commandant
for the French in the country west of Lake
Michigan. In all this vast district, Enjalran was then
the only priest. In token of his appreciation of its
work, Perrot presented to the mission a beautiful silver
<i>ostensorium</i> (or <i>soleil</i>) made in Paris. The <i>ostensorium</i>
is one of the vessels used at the altar, in celebrating the
mass.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
This was in the year 1686; the following year,
during one of the frequent outbursts of Indian hostility
against the missionaries, Enjalran was obliged to fly for
his life. In order to lighten his burden, he buried this
silver vessel, evidently intending to return
some time and regain possession of it.</p>

<p>In 1802, a hundred and fifteen years
later, a man was digging a cellar in Green
Bay, several miles lower down the bank
of the Fox River than is De Pere, when
his pickax ran through this piece of silver.
It was brought to light, and for safe
keeping was given to the Catholic priest
then at Green Bay. Nobody would have
known its story except for the clearly
engraved inscription on the bottom; the
words are in French, but in English they
signify: "This soleil was given by Mr.
Nicolas Perrot to the mission of St. Francis
Xavier, at the Bay of the Puants, 1686"; for the
early French name for Green Bay was "Bay of the
Puants." The old <i>ostensorium</i>, with its inscription just
as plainly to be read to-day as when engraved over
two centuries ago, can now be seen among the treasures
of the State Historical Society, at Madison. It
is an enduring memorial to the labors and the sufferings
of Wisconsin's first missionaries.</p>

<h2 id="SOME_NOTABLE_VISITORS_TO_EARLY_WISCONSIN">SOME NOTABLE VISITORS TO EARLY WISCONSIN</h2>

<p>It has been pointed out that wandering fur traders
were in Wisconsin at a very early date. We have
seen that Nicolet, Radisson, and Groseilliers made
Wisconsin known to the world, at a time when Massachusetts
colony was still young. It will be remembered
that when Father M&eacute;nard went to Lake Superior, in
1660, to convert the Indians, there were several French
fur traders with him. As early as the spring of 1662,
these same traders had gone across country to the
mouth of the Fox River. Three years later the
Menominees and Pottawattomies, then living on both
sides of the bay, were visited by Nicolas Perrot, a
daring young spirit from Quebec, who had come to
the then Far West to make his fortune in trading with
the red men.</p>

<p>Perrot was one of the most picturesque characters
in Wisconsin history. In Canada he had been a
servant of the Jesuit missionaries, acquiring in this
work an education which was slight as to books, but
broad as to knowledge of the Indians and of forest life.
He was now twenty-one years of age, and started out
for himself as soon as he was his own master. For
five years Perrot wandered up and down the eastern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
half of Wisconsin, frequently visiting his friends, the
Mascoutins and Miamis, on the Fox River. He smoked
pipes of peace with them and with other forest and
prairie tribes, and joined in their feasts of beaver,
dog, and other savage delicacies.</p>

<p>In 1670 he and four other Frenchmen, packing their
furs into bundles of convenient size, joined a large
party of Indians going down to Montreal in canoes,
to trade. Perrot did not return with his companions,
but visited Quebec, and there received an appointment
from the government to rally the Western tribes in a
great council at Sault Ste. Marie. Here a treaty
was to be made, binding the savages to an alliance
with France. The French were very jealous of the
English, who had, through the guidance of Radisson
and Groseilliers, commenced fur trade operations in the
Hudson Bay country. It was feared that they would
entice the Indians of the upper Great Lakes to trade
with them, for the English offered higher prices for
furs than did the French.</p>

<p>Perrot spent the winter in visiting the tribes in Wisconsin
and along the northern shores of Lakes Michigan
and Huron, and succeeded in inducing large bands of
them to go to the Sault early in May (1671). The
council was attended by an enormous gathering, representing
tribes from all over the Northwest, even from
the north shores of Lake Superior and Hudson Bay.
Father Marquette was there with the Ottawas, and
several other famous missionaries came to the council.
The interpreter, who knew Indian dialects by the score,
was no less a person than Louis Joliet. The French<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
government was represented by Saint Lusson, who concluded
the desired treaty, with great ceremony, took
formal possession of all this country for the king of
France, and reared on the spot a great cedar pole, to
which he fastened a lead plate bearing the arms of
his country. This symbol the simple and wondering
savages could not understand: and as soon as the
Frenchmen had gone home again, they tore it down,
fearing that it was a charm which might bring bad
luck to the tribesmen.</p>

<p>And now we find Perrot suddenly losing his office,
and forced for ten years to live a quiet life in the
French settlements on the lower St. Lawrence. He
married a well-to-do young woman, reared a considerable
family, and became a man of some influence. But
he was always eager to be back in the forest, wandering
from tribe to tribe, and engaging in the wilderness
trade, where the profits were great, though the risks to
life and property were many. In 1681 he returned to
the woods, but not till three years later was he so far
west as Mackinac.</p>

<p>In 1685 he appeared once more at Green Bay, this
time holding the position of Commandant of the West,
with a little company of twenty soldiers. He now had
almost unlimited authority to explore and traffic as he
would, for the only salary an official of that sort used to
get, in New France, was the right to trade with the
Indians. He had already lost money in working for
the government as an Indian agent, and his present
operations were wholly directed toward getting it back
again. He went up the Fox and down the Wisconsin,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
and then ascended the Mississippi to trade with the
wild Sioux tribe. For headquarters, he erected a little
log stockade on the east bank of the Mississippi, about
a mile above the present village of Trempealeau, and
south of the mouth of Black River. In the year 1888,
the site of this old stockade was discovered by a party
of historical students, and many of the curious relics
found there can now be seen in the museum of the State
Historical Society, at Madison.</p>

<p>All through the winter of 1685-86, Perrot traded
here with the Sioux. He had a most captivating
manner of treating Indians; for a long time, few of
them ventured to deny any request made by him.
Chiefs from far and near would come to the Trempealeau
"fort," as it was called, and hold long councils
and feasts with the great white chief, and more than
once he was subjected to the curious Sioux ceremony
of being wept over. A chief would stand over his
guest and weep copiously, his tears falling upon the
guest's head; when the chief's tear ducts were exhausted,
he would be relieved by some headman of the
tribe, who in turn was succeeded by another, and so
on until the guest was well drenched. This must have
been a very trying experience to Perrot, but he was
shrewd enough to pretend to be much pleased by it.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1686, the same year in which he
gave the silver <i>ostensorium</i> to the Jesuit chapel at
De Pere, the commandant proceeded up the Mississippi
to the broadening which was, about this time, named
Lake Pepin by the French. On the Wisconsin shore,
not far above the present village of Pepin, he erected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
another and stronger stockade, Fort St. Antoine. It
was here, three years later, that, after the manner of
Saint Lusson at Sault Ste. Marie, he formally took possession,
in the name of his king, of all the Upper
Mississippi valley.</p>

<p>Several other forts were built by Perrot along the
Mississippi, none of them more than groups of stout
log houses. These were surrounded by a stockade wall
of heavy logs well planted in the ground, sharpened at
the top, pierced for musket fire, and sometimes surmounted
by a small cannon. The stockade whose ruins
were unearthed at Trempealeau, measured about forty-five
by sixty feet. One of his stockades, Fort Perrot,
was on the Minnesota shore of Lake Pepin; still
another, Fort St. Nicholas, was near the "lower town"
of the Prairie du Chien of to-day, at the confluence of
the Wisconsin and the Mississippi; and it also appears
that he had a stockade lower down the Mississippi, to
guard a lead mine which he had discovered near Galena,
because lead was an important article for both fur
traders and Indians. Sometimes traders fought among
themselves, for the possession of a lead mine.</p>

<p>Perrot made frequent voyages to the settlements on
the St. Lawrence River, and engaged in some of the
French expeditions against the hostile Iroquois of New
York. While, on the whole, he was successful in holding
the Western tribes in friendship to New France, his
position was not without grave perils. One time his old
friends, the Mascoutins, rose against him, claiming that
he had killed one of their warriors. The claim may
have been true, for he was a man of violent temper, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
ruled the Wisconsin forests after the despotic fashion
of an Asiatic prince. The Mascoutins captured Perrot,
in company with a Pottawattomie chief, and carrying
them to their village, robbed the commandant of all his
furs, and decided to burn the prisoners at the stake.
But while being conducted to the fire, the two managed
by artifice to escape, and at last reached in safety their
friends at the mouth of the Fox River. Another time,
the Miamis captured Perrot, and would have burned
him except for the interference of the Fox Indians,
with whom he was friendly.</p>

<p>In 1699, owing to the uprising of the Foxes, the king
ordered that all the Western posts be abandoned, and
their little garrisons removed to Montreal and Quebec.
Thus suddenly ended the career of Perrot, who returned
a poor man, for his recent losses in furs had been heavy,
and his expenses of keeping up the posts large. Again
and again he sought redress from the government, and
the Wisconsin Foxes earnestly pleaded that he be sent
back to them, as "the best beloved of all the French
who have ever been among us." But his star had set,
he no longer had influence; and it had just been decided
to punish his friends the Foxes. Perrot lived about
twenty years longer, on the banks of the Lower St.
Lawrence, and died in old age, like Joliet, in neglect
and poverty.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/image065.jpg" width="600" height="496" alt="" />
</div>

<p>During much of the time that Perrot was commandant
of the West, several other great fur traders were
conducting operations in Wisconsin. The greatest of
these was the Chevalier La Salle, the famous explorer,
who plays a large part on the stage of Western history,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
particularly in the history of the Mississippi valley. It
has been claimed for La Salle that he was in Wisconsin
in 1671, two years before Joliet, and actually canoed on
the Mississippi River, but this is more than doubtful.
We do know that in 1673 one of his agents was trading
with the Sioux to the west of Lake Superior; and that
in 1679 he came to Green Bay in a small vessel called
the <i>Griffin</i>, the first sailing craft on the Great Lakes
above the cataract of Niagara. La Salle was a <i>coureur
de bois</i>, most of this time, for he operated in a field far
larger than that for which he had a license. Leaving
his ship, which was afterward wrecked, he and fourteen
of his men proceeded in canoes southward along the
western coast of Lake Michigan, visiting the sites of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
Milwaukee and other Wisconsin lakeshore cities.
Finally, after many strange adventures, they ascended
St. Joseph River, crossed over to the Kankakee
River, and spent the winter in a log fort which they
built on Peoria Lake, a broadening of the Illinois River.</p>

<p>At least one priest was thought necessary in every
well-equipped exploring expedition. La Salle had quarreled
with the Jesuits, and hated them; hence the
ministers of religion in his party were three Franciscan
friars, one of them being Father Louis Hennepin,
who afterward became famous. When La Salle determined
to spend the winter at Peoria Lake, he sent
Hennepin forward with two <i>coureurs de bois</i>, to explore
the upper waters of the Mississippi. These three adventurers
descended the Illinois River in their canoe,
and then ascended the Mississippi to the Falls of
St. Anthony, where now lies the great city of Minneapolis;
there they met some Sioux, and went with
them upon a buffalo hunt. But the Indians, although
at first friendly, soon turned out to be a bad lot, for
they robbed their guests, and practically held them as
prisoners.</p>

<p>This was in the early summer of 1680. Luckily for
Hennepin and his companions, the powerful <i>coureur de
bois</i>, Daniel Graysolon Duluth (<i>du Luth</i>) appeared on
the scene. Duluth was, next to Perrot, the leading man
in the country around Lake Superior and the Upper
Mississippi valley. He had been spending the winter
trading with the Sioux in the lake country of northern
Minnesota, and along Pigeon River, which is now the
dividing line between Minnesota and Canada. With a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
party of ten of his boatmen, he set out in June to reach
the Mississippi, his route taking him up the turbulent
little Bois Brul&eacute; River, over the mile and a half of
portage trail to Upper Lake St. Croix, and down
St. Croix River to the Mississippi. On reaching the
latter, he learned of the fact that Europeans were being
detained and maltreated by the Sioux, and at once went
and rescued them. The summer was spent among the
Indians in company with Hennepin's party, who, now
that Duluth was found to be their friend, were handsomely
treated. In the autumn, Duluth, Hennepin, and
their companions all returned down the Mississippi, up
the Wisconsin, and down the Fox, and spent the winter
at Mackinac. After that, Duluth was frequently upon
the Fox-Wisconsin route, and traded for buffalo hides
and other furs with the Wisconsin tribes.</p>

<p>Another famous visitor to Wisconsin, in those early
days, was Pierre le Sueur, who in 1683 traveled from
Lake Michigan to the Mississippi, over the Fox-Wisconsin
route, and traded with the Sioux at the Falls of
St. Anthony and beyond. His fur trade grew, in a few
years, to large proportions; for he was a shrewd man,
and was related to some of the officials of New France.
This enabled him to secure trading licenses for the
Western country, and other valuable privileges, which
gave him an advantage over the unlicensed traders, like
Duluth, who had no official friends. In 1693, Le Sueur
was trading in Duluth's old country; and, in order to
protect the old Bois Brul&eacute; and St. Croix route from
marauding Indians, he built a log fort at either end,
one on Chequamegon Bay, and the other on an island<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
in the Mississippi, below the mouth of the St. Croix.
A few years later, Le Sueur was in France, where he
obtained a license to operate certain "mines of lead,
copper, and blue and green earth," which he claimed
to have discovered along the banks
of the Upper Mississippi. In
the summer of
1700, he and his
party opened
lead mines in the
neighborhood of
the present Dubuque
and Galena,
and also near
the modern town
of Potosi, Wisconsin.
He does not
appear to have
been very successful
as a miner; but
his fur trade was
still enormous, and
his many explorations
led to the Upper
Mississippi being
quite correctly represented
on the maps of America, made
by the European geographers.</p>

<p>A missionary priest, Father St. Cosme, of Quebec,
was in Green Bay in October, 1699, and proposed to
visit the Mississippi region, by way of the Fox and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
Wisconsin rivers. But the warlike Foxes, who were
giving the French a great deal of trouble at this time,
had forbidden any white man passing over this favorite
waterway, so St. Cosme was obliged to go the way that
La Salle had followed, up the west shore of Lake
Michigan and through Illinois. The party stopped at
many places along the Wisconsin lake shore, but the
only ones which we can identify are the sites of Sheboygan
and Milwaukee, where there were large Indian
villages.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that these were all the
Frenchmen to tarry in or pass through Wisconsin
during the latter half of the seventeenth century.
Doubtless there were scores, if not hundreds of others,
fur traders, <i>voyageurs</i>, soldiers, and priests; we have
selected but a few of those whose movements were
recorded in the writings of their time. Wisconsin was
a key point in the geography of the West; here were
the interlaced sources of rivers flowing north into Lake
Superior, east and northeast into Lake Michigan, and
west and southwest into the Mississippi River. The
canoe traveler from Lower Canada could, with short
portages, pass through Wisconsin into waters reaching
far into the interior of the continent, even to the Rocky
Mountains, the lakes of the Canadian Northwest, and
the Gulf of Mexico. This is why the geography of
Wisconsin became known so early in the history of our
country, why Wisconsin Indians played so important a
part on the stage of border warfare, and why history was
being made here at a time when some of the States to
the east of us were still almost unknown to white men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<h2 id="A_QUARTER_OF_A_CENTURY_OF_WARFARE">A QUARTER OF A CENTURY OF WARFARE</h2>

<p>Wisconsin was important, from a geographical
point of view, because here were the meeting
places of waters which flowed in so many directions;
here were the gates which opened upon widely divergent
paths. The explorer and the fur trader soon
discovered this, and Wisconsin became known to them
at a very early period. France had two important
colonies in North America, New France (or Canada),
upon the St. Lawrence River, and Louisiana, extending
northward indefinitely from the Gulf of Mexico.
It was found necessary, in pushing her claim to the
ownership of all of the continent west of the Alleghany
Mountains and east of the Rockies, to connect New
France and Louisiana with a chain of little forts along
the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River. The forts
at Detroit, Mackinac, Green Bay, Prairie du Chien,
and Kaskaskia (in Illinois) were links in this chain, at
the center of which was Wisconsin; or, to use another
figure, Wisconsin was the keystone of the arch which
bridged the two French colonies.</p>

<p>There were six principal canoe routes between the
Great Lakes and the Mississippi: one by way of the
Maumee and Wabash rivers, another by way of St.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
Joseph River and the Kankakee and the Illinois, another
by way of the St. Joseph, Wabash, and Ohio
rivers, still another by way of the Chicago River and
the Illinois, and we have already seen that from Lake
Superior there were used the Bois Brul&eacute; and the St.
Croix routes. But the easiest of all, the favorite gateway,
was the Fox-Wisconsin route, for all the others
involved considerable hardship; this is why Wisconsin
was so necessary to the French military officers in
holding control of the interior of the continent.</p>

<p>Affairs went well enough so long as the French were
on good terms with the warlike and crafty Fox Indians,
who held control of the Fox River. But after a time
the Foxes became uneasy. The fur trade in New
France was in the hands of a monopoly, which charged
large fees for licenses, and fixed its own prices on the
furs which it bought, and on the Indian goods which it
sold to the forest traders. On the other hand, the fur
trade in the English colonies east of the Alleghanies
was free; any man could engage in it and go wherever
he would. The result was that the English, with the
strong competition among themselves, paid higher
prices to the Indians for furs than the French could
afford, and their prices for articles which the Indians
wanted were correspondingly lower than those of the
French.</p>

<p>The Indians were always eager for a bargain; and
although the French declared that those trading with
the English were enemies of New France, they persisted
in secretly sending trading parties to the English,
who were now beginning to swarm into the Ohio<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
valley. The Foxes, in particular, grew very angry with
the French for charging them such high prices, and
resented the treatment which they received at the hands
of the traders from Quebec and Montreal. At one time
they told Perrot that they would pack up their wigwams,
and move in a body to the Wabash River or to
the Ohio, and form a league with the fierce Iroquois
of New York, who were friends and neighbors of the
English. Had they done so, the French
fur trade in the West would have
suffered greatly.</p>

<p>The Foxes began to
make it disagreeable
for the French in
Wisconsin. They
insisted on collecting
tolls on fur trade
bateaux which were being
propelled up the Fox
River, and even stopped
traders entirely; several
murders of Frenchmen
were also charged to
them. The French thereupon
determined to punish
these rebellious savages who sat
within the chief gateway to the
Mississippi. In the winter of
1706-07, a large party of soldiers, <i>coureurs des bois</i>,
and half-breeds, under a captain named Marin, ascended
the Fox River on snowshoes and attacked the Foxes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
together with their allies, the Sacs, at a large village
at Winnebago Rapids, near where is now the city of
Neenah.</p>

<p>Several hundreds of the savages were killed in this
assault, but its effect was to make the Foxes the more
troublesome. A few summers later, this same Marin
arranged again to surprise the enemy. His boats were
covered with oilcloth blankets, in the manner adopted
by the traders to protect the goods against rain; only
two <i>voyageurs</i> were visible in each boat to propel it.
Arriving at the foot of Winnebago Rapids, the canoes
were ranged along the shore, and nearly fifteen hundred
Indians came out and squatted on the bank, ready to
collect toll of the traders. All of a sudden the covers
were thrown off, and the armed men appeared and
raked the Indians with quick volleys of lead, while a
small cannon in Marin's boat increased the effectiveness
of the attack. Tradition says that over a thousand
Foxes and Sacs fell in this massacre; this is one of the
many incidents in white men's relations with the Indians,
wherein savages were outsavaged in the practice
of ferocious treachery.</p>

<p>Despite the great slaughter, there appear to have
been enough Foxes left to continue giving the French
a great deal of annoyance. There were fears at Quebec
that it might be necessary to abandon the attempt
to connect New France and Louisiana by a trail
through the Western woods, in which case the English
would have a free run of the Mississippi valley.
There seem, however, not to have been any more warlike
expeditions to Wisconsin for several years. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
in May, 1712, the French induced large numbers of the
Foxes, with their friends, the Mascoutins, the Kickapoos,
and the Sacs, to come to Detroit for the making
of a treaty of peace. At the same time the French
also assembled there large bands of the Pottawattomies
and Menominees from Wisconsin, with Illinois Indians,
some camps from Missouri, and Hurons and Ottawas
from the Lake Huron country; all of these were enemies
of the Foxes.</p>

<p>The records do not show just why it happened; but
for some reason the French and their allies fired on the
Foxes and their friends, who were well intrenched in a
palisaded camp outside the walls of Detroit. A great
siege ensued, lasting nineteen days, in which the
slaughter on both sides was heavy; but at last the
Foxes, worn out by loss of numbers, hunger, and disease,
took advantage of a dark, rainy night to escape
northward. They were pursued the following day, but
again intrenched themselves with much skill, and withstood
another siege of five days, when they surrendered.
The French and their savage allies fell upon
the poor captives with fury and slew nearly all of them,
men, women, and children.</p>

<p>The poor Foxes had lost in this terrible experience
upward of fifteen hundred of the bravest of their tribe,
which was now reduced to a few half-starved bands.
But their spirit was not gone. Next year the officers
at Quebec wrote home to Paris: "The Fox Indians
are daily becoming more insolent." They had begun
to change their tactics; instead of wasting their energies
on the French, they began to make friends<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
with, or to intimidate, neighboring tribes. By means
of small, secret war parties, they would noiselessly
swarm out of the Wisconsin forests and strike hard
blows at the prairie Indians of Illinois, who preferred
to remain their enemies. In this manner the Illinois
Indians were reduced to a mere handful, and were compelled
to seek shelter under the guns of the French
fort at Kaskaskia. At the same time the Foxes were
in close alliance with the Sioux and other great
western tribes, who helped them lock the
gate of the Fox-Wisconsin rivers, and plunder
and murder French traders wherever
they could be found throughout Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Again it seemed evident that
New France, unless something
were done, could never maintain
its chain of communication with Louisiana,
or conduct any fur trade in
the Northwest. The something
decided on was an attempt to
destroy the Foxes, root and
branch. For this purpose
there was sent out to Wisconsin,
in 1716, a well-equipped
expedition
under an experienced
captain named De
Louvigny, numbering
eight hundred
men, whites and
Indians. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
Foxes were found living in a walled town upon the
mound now known as Little Butte des Morts, on the
west side of Fox River, opposite the present Neenah.
The wall consisted of three rows of stout palisades, re&euml;nforced
by a deep ditch; tradition says there were
here assembled five hundred braves and three thousand
squaws and other noncombatants.</p>

<p>The French found it necessary to lay siege to this
forest fortress, just as they would attack a European
city of that time; trenches and mines were laid, and
pushed forward at night, until, at the close of the
third day, everything was ready to blow up the palisades.
At this point the Foxes surrendered, but they
gained easy terms for those days, for De Louvigny was
no butcher of men, and appeared to appreciate their
bravery. They gave up their prisoners, they furnished
enough slaves to the allies of the French to take the
place of the warriors slain, they agreed to furnish furs
enough to pay the expenses of the expedition, and sent
six hostages to Quebec to answer for their future behavior.
The next year, De Louvigny returned to the
valley of the Fox, from Quebec, and made a treaty with
the Foxes, but nothing came of it. Treaties were easily
made with Indian tribes, in the days of New France,
and as easily broken by either side.</p>

<p>In the very next year, the Foxes were again making
raids on the French-loving Illinois, and the entire West
was, as usual, torn by strife. It was evident that the
Foxes were trying to gain control of the Illinois River,
and thus command both of the principal roads to the
Mississippi. The French were at this time enthusiastic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
over great schemes for opening mines on the
Mississippi, operating northward from Louisiana; agriculture
was beginning to flourish around Kaskaskia;
and grain, flour, and furs were being shipped down the
Mississippi to the French islands in the West Indies,
and across the ocean to France. More than ever was
it necessary to unite Louisiana with Canada by a line
of communication.</p>

<p>But just now the Foxes were stronger than they had
been at any time. Their shrewd warriors had organized
a great confederacy to shut out the French, and thereby
advance the cause of English trade, although it is not
known that the English assisted in this widespread
conspiracy. Fox warriors were sent with pipes of peace
among the most distant tribes of the West, the South,
and the North, and it seemed as if the whole interior of
the continent were rising in arms. A French writer of
the period says of the Foxes: "Their fury increased as
their forces diminished. On every side they raised up
new enemies against us. The whole course and neighborhood
of the Mississippi is infested with Indians with
whom we have no quarrel, and who yet give to the
French no quarter."</p>

<p>This condition lasted for a few years. But Indian
leagues do not ordinarily long endure. We soon find
the Foxes weak again, with few to back them; in 1726,
at a council in Green Bay, they were apologizing for
having made so much trouble. The French were, however,
still afraid of these wily folk, and two years later
(1728) a little army of four hundred Frenchmen and nine
hundred Indian allies advanced on the Fox villages by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
way of the Ottawa River route and Mackinac. The
Foxes, together with their Winnebago friends, had heard
of the approach of the whites, and fled; but the white
invaders burned every deserted village in the valley,
and destroyed all the crops, leaving the red men to
face the rigor of winter with neither huts nor food.</p>

<p>Fleeing from their native valley before the onset of
the army, the unhappy fugitives, said to have been
four thousand in number, descended the Wisconsin and
ascended the Mississippi, to find their Sioux allies in
the neighborhood of Lake Pepin. But the Sioux had
been won by French presents, distributed from the fur
trade fort on that lake, and turned the starving tribesmen
away; the ever-treacherous Winnebagoes of the
party sided with the Sioux; the Sacs expressed repentance,
and hurried home to Green Bay to make their
peace with the French; the Mascoutins now proved to
be enemies. Thus deserted, the disconsolate Foxes
passed the winter in Iowa, and sent messengers to the
Green Bay fort, begging for forgiveness.</p>

<p>But there was no longer any peace for the Foxes.
Indians friendly with the French attacked one of their
Iowa camps; and in the autumn of 1729 they sought in
humble fashion to return to the valley of the Fox; but
they were ambuscaded by a French-directed party of
Ottawas, Menominees, Chippewas, and Winnebagoes,
and after a fierce fight lost nearly three hundred by
death and capture; the prisoners, men, women, and
children, were burned at the stake.</p>

<p>Turning southward, the greater part of the survivors
of this ill-starred tribe sought a final asylum upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
the Illinois River, not far from Peoria. Three noted
French commanders, heads of garrisons in the Western
country, now gathered their forces, which aggregated a
hundred and seventy Frenchmen and eleven hundred
Indians; and in August, 1730, gave battle to the fugitives,
who were now outnumbered full four to one.
The contest, notable for the gallant sorties of the besieged
and the cautious military engineering of the
besiegers, lasted throughout twenty-two days; probably
never in the history of the West has there been witnessed
more heroic conduct than was displayed during
this remarkable campaign. It was inevitable that the
Foxes should lose in the end, but they sold themselves
dearly. Not over fifty or sixty escaped; and it is said
that three hundred warriors perished in battle or afterwards
at the stake, while six hundred women and children
were either tomahawked or burned.</p>

<p>It is surprising, after all these massacres, that there
were any members of the tribe left; yet we learn that
two years later (1732) three hundred of them were living
peaceably on the banks of the Wisconsin River,
when still another French and Indian band swept down
upon and either captured or slaughtered them all. Of
another small party, which sought mercy from the officer
of the fort at Green Bay, several, including the
head chief of the Foxes, Kiala, were sent away into
slavery, and wore away their lives in menial drudgery
upon the tropical island of Martinique.</p>

<p>The remainder took refuge with the Sacs, on Fox
River; and the following year the French commander
at Green Bay asked the Sacs to give them up. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
time the Sacs proved to be good friends, and refused;
and in the quarrel which followed at the Sac town,
eight French soldiers were killed. This led to later
retaliation on the part of the French, but in the battle
which was fought both sides lost heavily; and then
both Sacs and Foxes fled from the country, never to
return. They settled upon the banks of the Des
Moines River, in Iowa, whither French hate again
sought them out in 1734. This last expedition, however,
was a failure, and the Fox War was finally ended,
after twenty-five years of almost continuous bloodshed.
During this war not only had the great tribe of the
Foxes been almost annihilated, but the power of France
in the West had meanwhile been greatly weakened by
the persistent opposition of those who had held the key
to her position.</p>

<h2 id="THE_COMMERCE_OF_THE_FOREST">THE COMMERCE OF THE FOREST</h2>

<p>We have seen in previous chapters why Wisconsin,
with her intermingling rivers, was considered
the key to the French position in the interior of North
America; why it was that fur traders early sought this
State, and erected log forts along its rivers and lakes to
protect their commerce with the people of the forest.
It remains to be told what were the conditions of this
widespreading and important forest trade.</p>

<p>The French introduced to our Indians iron pots and
kettles, which were vastly stronger than their crude
utensils of clay; iron fishhooks, hatchets, spears, and
guns, which were not only more durable, but far more
effective than their old weapons of stone and copper
and bone; cloths and blankets of many colors, from
which attractive clothing was more easily made than
from the skins of beasts; and glass beads and silver
trinkets, for the decoration of their clothing and bodies,
which cost far less labor to obtain than did ornaments
made from clam shells. To secure these French goods,
the Indians had but to hunt and bring the skins to
the white men. The Indian who could secure a gun
found it easier to get skins than before, and he also had
a weapon which made him more powerful against his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
enemies. It was not long before the Indian forgot how
to make utensils and weapons for himself, and became
very dependent on the white trader. This is why the
fur trade was at the bottom of every event in the
forest, and for full two hundred years was of supreme
importance to all the people who lived in the Wisconsin
woods.</p>

<p>All trade in New France was in the control of a
monopoly, which charged heavy fees for licenses,
severely punished all the unlicensed traders who could
be detected, and fixed its own prices for everything.
French traders were obliged, therefore, to charge the
Indians more for their goods than the English charged
for theirs; and it was a continual and often bloody
struggle to keep the Indians of the Northwest from
having any trade with the English colonists from the
Atlantic coast, who had with great labor crossed the
Alleghany Mountains and were now swarming into
the Ohio River valley. It was impossible to prevent the
English trade altogether, but the policy was in the main
successful, although it cost the French a deal of anxiety,
and sometimes great expense in military operations.</p>

<p>During the greater part of the French r&eacute;gime in Wisconsin,
the bulk of the goods for the Indians came up
by the Ottawa River route, because the warlike Iroquois
of New York favored the English, and for a long time
kept Frenchmen from entering the lower lakes of Ontario
and Erie. Finally, however, after the fort at Detroit
was built (1701), the lower lakes came to be used.</p>

<p>It was, by either route, a very long and tiresome journey
from Quebec or Montreal to Wisconsin, and owing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
to the early freezing of the Straits of Mackinac, but
one trip could be made in a year. It was not, however,
necessary for every trader to go to the "lower settlements"
each year. At the Western forts large stocks
of goods were kept, and there the furs were stored,
sometimes for several seasons, until a great fleet
of canoes could be made up by bands of
traders and friendly Indians; and then the
expedition to Montreal was made, with
considerable display of barbaric
splendor. When the
traders reached Montreal,
the inhabitants
of the settlement turned out to welcome their
visitors from the wilderness, and something akin to a
great fair was held, at which speculators bought up the
furs, feasts were eaten and drunk, and fresh treaties<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
of peace were made with the Indians. A week or two
would thus pass in universal festivity, at the end of
which traders and savages would seek their canoes,
and, amid volleys of cannon from the fort, martial
music, the fluttering of flags, and the shouts of the
<i>habitants</i>, the fleet would push off, and soon be swallowed
again by the all-pervading forest.</p>

<p>When the French were driven out of Canada, in
1760, and the British assumed control, the English
Hudson Bay Company began spreading its operations
over the Northwest. But in 1783, at the close of the
Revolutionary War, the Northwest Company was organized,
with headquarters at Montreal. The British still
held possession of our Northwest long after the treaty
with the United States was signed. Soon sailing ships
were introduced, and many goods were thus brought to
Mackinac, Green Bay, and Chequamegon Bay; nevertheless,
canoes and bateaux, together with the more
modern "Mackinac boats" and "Durham boats," were
for many years largely used upon these long Western
journeys from Montreal. To a still later date were
these rude craft sent out from the Mackinac warehouses
to Wisconsin, or from Mackinac to the famous
headquarters of the company at the mouth of Pigeon
River, on the western shore of Lake Superior, the
"Grand Portage," as it was called.</p>

<p>It was a life filled with great perils, by land and
flood; many were the men who lost their lives in
storms, in shooting river rapids, in deadly quarrels
with one another or with the savages, by exposure to
the elements, or by actual starvation. Yet there was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
glamour over these wild experiences, as is customary
wherever men are associated as comrades in an outdoor
enterprise involving common dangers and hardships.
The excitement and freedom of the fur trade appealed
especially to the volatile, fun loving French; and music
and badinage and laughter often filled the day.</p>

<p>After the Americans assumed control, in 1816, Congress
forbade the British to conduct the fur trade in
our country. This was
to prevent them from
influencing the Western
Indians to war; but
turning out the English
traders served greatly
to help the American
Fur Company, founded
by John Jacob Astor,
and having its headquarters
on the Island
of Mackinac. Nevertheless
the agents, the
clerks, and the <i>voyageurs</i> were still nearly all of them
Frenchmen, as of old, and there was really very little
change in the methods of doing business, except that
Astor managed to reap most of the profits.</p>

<p>The fur trade lasted, as a business of prime importance
to Wisconsin, until about 1835. It was at its
greatest height in 1820, at which time Green Bay was
the chief settlement in Wisconsin. By 1835 new interests
had arisen, with the development of the lead mines
in the southwest, and with the advent of agricultural<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
settlers from the East, upon the close of the Black
Hawk War (1832).</p>

<p>The fur trade led the way to the agricultural and
manufacturing life of to-day. The traders naturally
chose Indian villages as the sites for most of their
posts, and such villages were generally at places well
selected for the purpose. They were on portage trails,
where craft had to be carried around falls or rapids, as
at De Pere, Kaukauna, Appleton, and Neenah; or they
were on portage plains, between distinct water systems,
as at Portage and Sturgeon Bay; or they were at the
mouths or junctions of rivers, as at Milwaukee, Sheboygan,
Oshkosh, Lacrosse, and Prairie du Chien; or they
occupied commanding positions on lake or river bank,
overlooking a wide stretch of country. Thus most of
the leading cities of Wisconsin are on the sites of old
Indian villages; for the reasons which led to their
choice by the Indians held good with the white pioneers
in the old days when rivers and lakes were the
chief highways. Thus we have first the Indian village,
then the trading post, and later the modern town.</p>

<p>The Indian trails were also largely used by the traders
in seeking the natives in their villages; later these
trails developed into public roads, when American settlers
came to occupy the country. Thus we see that
Wisconsin was quite thoroughly explored, its principal
cities and highways located, and its water ways mapped
out by the early French, long before the inrush of
agricultural colonists.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span></p>

<h2 id="IN_THE_OLD_FRENCH_DAYS">IN THE OLD FRENCH DAYS</h2>

<p>In establishing their chain of rude forts, or trading
posts, along the Great Lakes and through the valley
of the Mississippi, the French had no desire to plant
agricultural settlements in the West. Their chief
thought was to keep the continental interior as a great
fur bearing wilderness; to encourage the Indians to
hunt for furs, by supplying all their other wants with
articles made in Europe; and to prevent them from
carrying any of their furs to the English, who were
always underbidding the French in prices.</p>

<p>The officers of these forts were instructed to bully
or to persuade the Indians, as occasion demanded; and
some of them became very successful in this forest
diplomacy. Around most of the forts were small groups
of temporary settlers, who could hardly be called colonists,
for they expected when they had made their
fortunes, or when their working days were over, to
return to their own people on the lower St. Lawrence
River. It was rather an army of occupation, than a
body of settlers. Nearly every one in the settlement
was dependent on the fur trade, either as agent, clerk,
trapper, boatman, or general employee.</p>

<p>Sometimes these little towns were the outgrowth of
early Jesuit missions, as La Pointe (on Chequamegon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
Bay), or Green Bay (De Pere); but sooner or later
the fur trade became the chief interest. Most of the
towns, however, like Milwaukee, La Crosse, or Prairie
du Chien, were the direct outgrowth of commerce with
the savages. There were trading posts, also, on Lakes
Chetek, Flambeau, Court Oreilles, and Sandy, but the
settlements about them were very small, and they never
grew into permanent towns, as did some of the others.</p>

<p>At all these places, the little log forts served as depots
for furs and the goods used in trading with the
Indians; they were also used as rallying points for the
traders and other white inhabitants of the district, in
times of Indian attack. They would have been of
slight avail against an enemy with cannon, but afforded
sufficient protection against the arrows, spears, and
muskets of savages.</p>

<p>The French Canadians who lived in these waterside
hamlets were an easy-going folk. Nearly all of them
were engaged in the fur trade at certain seasons of the
year. The <i>bourgeois</i>, or masters, were the chiefs. The
<i>voyageurs</i> were men of all work, propelling the canoes
and bateaux when afloat, carrying the craft and their
contents over portages, transporting packs of goods and
furs along the forest trails, caring for the camps, and
acting as guards for the persons and property of their
employers. The <i>coureurs de bois</i>, or wood rangers,
were everywhere; they were devoted to a life in the
woods, for the fun and excitement in it; they conducted
trade on their own account, far off in the most inaccessible
places, and were men of great daring. Then there
were the <i>habitants</i>, or permanent villagers; sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
these worked as <i>voyageurs</i>, but for the most part
they were farmers in a small way, cultivating long,
narrow "claims" running at right angles to the river
bank; one can still find at Green Bay and Prairie du
Chien, traces of some of these old "French claims."
The object of having them so narrow was, that the
<i>habitants</i> could live close to one another,
along the waterside.</p>

<p>They were of a
very social nature,
these French <i>habitants</i>.
They liked
to meet frequently,
enjoy their pipes,
and tell stories of
the hunt or of old days
on the St. Lawrence.
They were famous fiddlers,
too. No wilderness
so far away
that the little French
fiddle had not been
there; the Indians recognized it as a
part of the furniture of every fur trader's camp.
Music appealed strongly to these warm natures, and
the songs of the <i>voyageurs</i>, as they propelled their
canoes along the Wisconsin rivers, always greatly interested
travelers. French Canadians are still living in
Wisconsin, who remember those gay melodies which
echoed through our forests a hundred years ago.</p>

<p>The old French life continued in Wisconsin until well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
into the nineteenth century. Although New France fell
in 1760, and the British came into control, they never
succeeded in Anglicizing Wisconsin. English fur companies
succeeded the French, and British soldiers occupied
the Wisconsin forts; but the fur trade itself had
still to be conducted through French residents, who
alone had the confidence of the Indians. Great Britain
was supposed to surrender all this country to the
United States in 1796; but it was really 1816 before
the American flag floated over Green Bay, and the
American Fur Company came into power. But, even
under this company, most of the actual trading was
done through the French; so we may say that as long
as the fur trade remained the chief industry of Wisconsin,
about to the year 1835, the old French life was still
maintained, and French methods were everywhere in
evidence.</p>

<p>It is surprising how strongly marked upon our Wisconsin
are the memories of the old French days. A
quiet, unobtrusive people, were those early French,
without high ambitions, and simple in their tastes; yet
they and theirs have displayed remarkable tenacity of
life, and doubtless their effect upon us of to-day will
never be effaced. Our map is sprinkled all over
with the French names which they gave to our hills
and lakes and streams, and early towns. We may here
mention a few only, at random: Lakes Flambeau,
Court Oreilles, Pepin, Vieux D&eacute;sert; the rivers Bois
Brul&eacute;, Eau Claire, Eau Pleine, Embarrass, St. Croix;
the counties Eau Claire, Fond du Lac, La Crosse, Langlade,
Marquette, Portage, Racine, St. Croix, Trempealeau;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
the towns of Racine, La Crosse, Prairie du
Chien, Butte des Morts. Scores of others can readily
be found in the atlas. In the cities of Green Bay,
Kaukauna, Portage, and Prairie du Chien, and the
dreamy little Fox River hamlet of Grand Butte des
Morts, are still to be found little closely-knit colonies
of French Creoles, descendants of those who lived and
ruled under the old French r&eacute;gime.</p>

<p>The time must come, in the molding of all the
foreign elements in our midst into the American of the
future, when the French element will no longer exist
among us as an element, but merely as a memory. If
our posterity can inherit from those early French occupants
of our soil their simple tastes, their warm hearts,
their happy temperament, their social virtues, then the old
French r&eacute;gime will have brought a blessing to Wisconsin,
and not merely a halo of historical romance.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<h2 id="THE_COMING_OF_THE_ENGLISH">THE COMING OF THE ENGLISH</h2>

<p>Upon the eighth day of September, 1760, the
French flag ceased to fly over Canada. In a
long and bitter struggle, lasting at intervals through
an entire century, French and English had been
battling with each other for the control of the interior
of this continent; and the former had lost
everything at the decisive battle on the Plains of
Abraham, before the walls of Quebec.</p>

<p>Reduced to the last extremity, the authorities of
New France had ordered her fur traders, <i>coureurs
de bois</i> and all, to hurry down to the settlements on
the St. Lawrence, and aid in protecting them against
the English. Thus in the Wisconsin forests, when the
end came, there were left no Frenchmen of importance.
Leaving their Indian friends, and many of them
their Indian wives and half-breed families, they had
obeyed the far away summons, and several lost their
lives in the great battle or in the skirmishes which
preceded it. The others, who at last returned, were
quick to show favor to the English, for little they
really cared who were their political masters so long
as they were let alone. The Indians, too, although
personally they preferred the French to the English,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
were glad enough to see the latter, because they
brought better prices for furs.</p>

<p>Wisconsin was so far away that it took a long time
for British soldiers to reach the deserted and tumbledown
fort at Green Bay. About the middle of October,
1761, there arrived from Mackinac Lieutenant James
Gorrell and seventeen men to hold all of this country
for King George. The station had been called by
the French Fort St. Francis, but the name was now
changed to Fort Edward Augustus.</p>

<p>It was a very lonely and dismal winter for the
British soldiers, for nearly all the neighboring savages
were away on their winter hunt and did not return until
spring. Mackinac, then a poor little trading village,
was two hundred forty miles away; there was a trading
post at St. Josephs on the southeast shore of Lake
Michigan, four hundred miles distant; and the nearest
French villages on the Mississippi were eight hundred
miles of canoe journey to the southwest. All
between was savagery: here and there a squalid Indian
village, with its conical wigwams of bark or
matted reeds, pitched on the shore of a lake, at the
foot of a portage trail, or on the banks of a forest
stream. Now and then a French trading party passed
along the frozen trails, following the natives on the
hunt and poisoning their minds against the newcomers,
who were struggling to make their poor old
stockade a fairly decent shelter against the winter
storms.</p>

<p>But, when the savages returned to Green Bay in
the spring, they met with fair words from Gorrell, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
plentiful distribution of presents, and good prices for
furs, and their hearts were won. In 1763 occurred
the great uprising led by Pontiac against the English
in the Northwest, during which the garrison at
Mackinac was massacred. This disturbed the friendship
of Gorrell's neighbors, with the exception of a
Menominee band, headed by chief Ogemaunee; and
in June of that year the little garrison, together with
the English traders at Green Bay, found it necessary
to leave hastily for Cross Village, on the eastern
shore of Lake Michigan, escorted by Ogemaunee
and ninety painted Menominees, who had volunteered
to protect these Englishmen from the unfriendly
Indians.</p>

<p>At Cross Village were several soldiers who had
escaped from Mackinac, and the two parties and their
escorts soon left in canoes for Montreal, by the way of
Ottawa River. This old fur trade route was followed
in order to escape Pontiac's Indians, who controlled
the country about Detroit and along the lower lake.
They arrived safely at their destination in August.
The following year there was held a great council at
Niagara, presided over by the famous Sir William
Johnson, who was then serving as British superintendent
for the Northern Indians. At this council
Ogemaunee was present representing the Menominees
of Wisconsin. In token of his valuable services in
escorting Lieutenant Gorrell's party to Montreal, and
thereby delivering them safely from the great danger
which threatened, Ogemaunee was given a certificate,
which reads as follows:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>This piece of paper, which showed that he was a
good friend of the English, was of almost as great
importance to Ogemaunee as a patent of nobility in the
Old World. He carried it with him back to Wisconsin,
and it remained in his family from one generation to
another, for fully a hundred years. One day a blanketed
and painted descendant of Ogemaunee presented
it to an American officer who visited his wigwam. This
descendant, doubtless, knew little of its meaning, but
it had been used in his family as a charm for bringing
good luck, and in his admiration for this kind officer
he gave it to him, for the Indian is, by nature, grateful
and generous. In the course of years the paper
was presented to the State Historical Society, by which
it is preserved as an interesting and suggestive relic
of those early days of the English occupation of Wisconsin.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span></p>

<h2 id="WISCONSIN_IN_THE_REVOLUTIONARY_WAR">WISCONSIN IN THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR</h2>

<p>We ordinarily think of the Revolutionary War as
having been fought wholly upon the Atlantic
slope. As a matter of fact, there were enacted west of
the Alleghanies, during that great struggle, deeds which
proved of immense importance to the welfare of the
United States. Had it not been for the capture from
the British of the country northwest of the Ohio River
by the gallant Virginia colonel, George Rogers Clark,
it is fair to assume that the Old Northwest, as it came
to be called, the present States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,
Michigan, and Wisconsin, would to-day be a part
of the Dominion of Canada.</p>

<p>After the brief flurry of the Pontiac conspiracy (1763),
the Indians of the Old Northwest became good friends
of the British, whose aim was to encourage the fur
trade and to keep the savages good-natured. The English
have always been more successful in their treatment
of Indians than have Americans; they are more generous
with them, and while not less firm than we, they
are more considerate of savage wants. The French
and the half-breeds, too, were very soon the warm supporters
of British policy, because English fur trade<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
companies gave them abundant employment, and
evinced no desire other than to foster the primitive
conditions under which the fur trade prospered.</p>

<p>The English were not desirous of settling the Western
wilderness with farmers, thereby driving out the
game. Our people, however, have always been of a
land-grabbing temper; we have sought to beat down
the walls of savagery, to push settlement, to cut down
the forests, to plow the land, to drive the Indian out.
This meant the death of the fur trade; hence it is
small wonder that, when the Revolutionary War broke
out, the French and Indians of the Northwest upheld
the British and opposed the Americans.</p>

<p>A number of scattered white settlers and a few small
villages had appeared along the Ohio River and many
of its southern tributaries. In Kentucky there were
several log forts, around each of which were grouped
the rude cabins of frontiersmen, who were half farmers
and half hunters, tall, stalwart fellows, as courageous
as lions, and ever on the alert for the crouching Indian
foe, who came when least expected. The country northwest
of the Ohio River was then a part of the British
province of Quebec. Here and there in this Old Northwest,
as we now call it, were small villages of French
and half-breed fur traders, each village protected by a
little log fort; some of these villages were garrisoned
by a handful of British soldiers, and others only by
French Canadians who were friendly to the English.
Such were Vincennes, in what is now Indiana; Kaskaskia
and Cahokia, in the Illinois country; Prairie du
Chien and Green Bay, in Wisconsin; and Mackinac<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
Island and Detroit, in Michigan. Detroit was the headquarters,
where lived the British lieutenant governor of
the Northwest, Henry Hamilton, a bold, brave, untiring,
unscrupulous man.</p>

<p>Hamilton's chief business was to gather about him the
Indians of the Northwest, and to excite in them hatred
of the American settlers in Kentucky. In 1777, war
parties sent out by him from Detroit, under cover of the
forts of Vincennes, Kaskaskia, and Cahokia, swept Kentucky
from end to end, and the whole American frontier
was the scene of a frightful panic. The American
backwoodsmen were ambushed, many of the blockhouse
posts were burned, prisoners were subjected to
nameless horrors, and it seemed as if pandemonium had
broken loose. By the close of the year, such had been
the rush of settlers back to their old homes, east of the
mountains, that but five or six hundred frontiersmen
remained in all Kentucky. Had the British and the
Indians succeeded in driving back all of the settlers,
they would have held the whole interior of the continent,
and the American republic might never have been
permitted to grow beyond the Alleghanies and the Blue
Ridge; hemmed in to the Atlantic slope, this could
never have become the great nation it is to-day.</p>

<p>Prominent among the defenders of Kentucky in 1777
was George Rogers Clark. He was but twenty-five
years of age, had come from a good family in Virginia,
and had a fair education for that day, but had been a
wood rover from childhood. He was tall and commanding
in person, a great hunter, and a backwoods
land surveyor, such as Washington was. With chain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
and compass, ax and rifle, he had, in the employ of land
speculators, wandered far and wide through the border
region, knowing its trails, its forts, its mountain passes,
and its aborigines better than he knew his books. Associated
with him were Boone, Benjamin Logan, and
others who were prominent among American border
heroes.</p>

<p>Clark saw that the best way to defend Kentucky was
to strike the enemy in their own country. Gaining
permission from Patrick Henry, governor of Virginia,
for Kentucky was then but a county of Virginia, and
obtaining some small assistance in money, he raised, in
1778, a little army of a hundred fifty backwoodsmen,
clad in buckskin and homespun, who came from the
hunters' camps of the Alleghanies. The men collected
at Pittsburg and Wheeling, and in flatboats cautiously
descended the Ohio to the falls, where is now the city
of Louisville. Here, on an island, they built a fort as
a military base, and the strongest of the party pushed
on down the river to the abandoned old French Fort
Massac, ten miles below the mouth of the Tennessee,
from which they marched overland, for a hundred
twenty miles, to Kaskaskia in western Illinois.</p>

<p>Capturing Kaskaskia by surprise (July 4), and soon
gaining the good will of the French there, Clark sent
out messengers who easily won over the neighboring
Cahokia; and very soon even Vincennes, on the Wabash
River, sent in its submission. It was not long before
Hamilton, at Detroit, heard the humiliating news. He
at once sent out two French agents, Charles de Langlade
and Charles Gautier, of Green Bay, to raise a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
large war party of Wisconsin Indians. They succeeded
so well, that Hamilton set out from Detroit in October,
to retake Vincennes. His force consisted of nearly two
hundred whites (chiefly French) and three hundred
Indians. Such were the obstacles to overcome in an
unbroken wilderness, that he was seventy-one days in
reaching his destination. Clark had left but two of his
soldiers at Vincennes, and as their French allies at
once surrendered, there was nothing to do but to give
up the place.</p>

<p>Now came one of the most stirring deeds in our Western
history. Clark, at Kaskaskia, soon learned of the
loss of Vincennes; at the same time, it was told him
that the greater part of Hamilton's expedition had disbanded
for the winter, the lieutenant governor intending
to launch a still larger war party against him in the
spring. Thereupon Clark determined not to await an
attack, but himself to make an attack on Hamilton,
who had remained in charge of Vincennes.</p>

<p>The distance across country, from Kaskaskia to Vincennes,
is about two hundred thirty miles. In summer
it was a delightful region of alternating groves and
prairies; in the dead of winter, it would afford fair
traveling over the frozen plains and ice-bound rivers;
but now, in February (1779), the weather had moderated,
and great freshets had flooded the lowlands and
meadows. The ground was boggy, and progress was
slow and difficult; there were no tents, and the floods
had driven away much of the game; and Clark and his
officers were often taxed to their wits' ends to devise
methods for keeping their hard-worked men in good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
spirits. Often they were obliged to wade in the icy
water, for miles together, and to sleep at night in
soaked clothes upon little brush-strewn hillocks, shivering
with cold, and without food or fire.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/image102.jpg" width="600" height="461" alt="" />
</div>

<p>But at last, after
nearly three weeks of almost superhuman
exertion and indescribable misery, Vincennes was
reached. The British garrison was taken by surprise,
but held out with obstinacy, and throughout the long
moonlight night the battle raged with much fury. The
log fort was on the top of a hill overlooking the little
town; it was armed with several small cannon, but
Clark's men had only their muskets. They were,
however, served freely with ammunition by the French
villagers; and, being expert marksmen, could hit the
gunners by firing through the loopholes, so that by
sunrise the garrison was sadly crippled. The fight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
continued throughout the following morning, and in
the afternoon the British ran up the white flag. Hamilton
and twenty-six of his fellows were sent as prisoners
overland to Virginia.</p>

<p>Clark remained as master of the Northwest until the
close of the Revolutionary War. The fact that the flag
of the republic waved over Vincennes, Kaskaskia, and
Cahokia when the war ended, had much to do with the
decision of the peace commissioners to allow the United
States to retain the country lying between the Ohio and
Mississippi rivers and the Great Lakes.</p>

<p>During the Revolution, none of the forts in Wisconsin
were occupied by British soldiers, and they were allowed
to tumble into decay. Wisconsin was, however, used as
a recruiting ground for Indian allies. Not only did
Langlade and Gautier raise a war party of Wisconsin
Indians to help Hamilton in his expedition against
Vincennes, but they were frequently in Wisconsin on
similar business during the war. In 1779 Gautier led
a party of Wisconsin Indians to Peoria, in the Illinois
country, where there was an old French fort which,
it was thought, might fall into the hands of the
Americans. Gautier burned this fort, and then hastily
retreated because he found that Clark was making
friends with all the Illinois Indians.</p>

<p>Clark's agents traded as far north as Portage, in
Wisconsin. At Prairie du Chien they induced Linctot,
a famous French fur trader, to join the Americans.
Linctot put himself at the head of a party of five
hundred French and half-breed horsemen, who were
of much assistance to Clark in his various movements<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
after the capture of Vincennes. Meanwhile another
large party, chiefly of Indians, assembled at Prairie
du Chien in the British cause, led by three French
traders, Hesse, Du Charme, and Calv&eacute;. They raided
the upper Mississippi valley, capturing provisions intended
for the Americans, and making a futile attack
on the Spanish village of St. Louis, which was thought
to be assisting Clark.</p>

<p>Despite these military operations in Wisconsin, the
English fur trade continued in full strength, with headquarters
upon the Island of Mackinac, but with French
agents and boatmen, whose principal dwelling places
were at Green Bay and Prairie du Chien. Upon Lake
Superior large canoes and bateaux were used; but
upon Lake Michigan were three small sloops, the
<i>Welcome</i>, the <i>Felicity</i>, and the <i>Archangel</i>, which carried
supplies and furs for the traders, and made frequent
cruises to see that the "Bostonians," as the
French used to call the Americans, obtained no foothold
upon the shore of the lake.</p>

<p>Just before the close of the war, the British commander
at Mackinac Island, Captain Patrick Sinclair,
held a council with the Indians, and for a small sum
purchased for himself their claims to that island and to
nearly all of the land now comprising Wisconsin. But
the treaty of 1783, between the British and the Americans,
did not recognize this purchase, and Sinclair
found that he was no longer the owner of Wisconsin.
It had become, largely through the valor of Clark, and
the persistence of our treaty commissioners, a part
of the territory of the United States.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span></p>

<h2 id="THE_RULE_OF_JUDGE_REAUME">THE RULE OF JUDGE R&Eacute;AUME</h2>

<p>By the treaty of peace with Great Britain, in 1783, the
country northwest of the Ohio River was declared
to be a part of the territory of the United States; but
it was many years before the Americans had anything
more than a nominal control of Wisconsin, which was
a part of this Northwestern region. The United States
was at first unable to meet all of its obligations under
this treaty; hence Great Britain kept possession of the
old fur trade posts on the Upper Lakes, including
Mackinac, of which Wisconsin was a "dependency."
A British garrison was kept at Mackinac, thus controlling
the fur trade of this district, but no troops were
deemed necessary within Wisconsin itself.</p>

<p>To the few white inhabitants of the small fur trade
villages of Green Bay and Prairie du Chien, there was
slight evidence of any of these various changes in political
ownership. Beyond the brief stay among them of
Lieutenant Gorrell and his little band of redcoats, in
the years 1761-63, the French and half-breeds of Wisconsin
led much the same life as of old.</p>

<p>In 1780, an English fur trader, John Long, passed up
the Fox River and down the Wisconsin, and bought up
a great many furs in this region. Some years later<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
he wrote a book about his travels, and from this we
get a very good idea of life among the French and
Indians of the Northwest. Long was at Green Bay
for several days, and tells us that the houses there
were covered with birch bark, and the rooms were
decorated with bows and arrows, guns, and spears.
There were in the village not over fifty whites, divided
into six or seven families. The men were for the
most part engaged as assistants to the two or three
leading traders; they spent their winters in the woods,
picking up furs at the Indian camps, and in summer
cultivated their narrow strips of gardens which
ran down to the river's edge. It mattered little to
them who was their political master, so long as they
were left to enjoy their simple lives in their own
fashion.</p>

<p>To this primitive community there came one day, in
1803, a portly, pompous, bald headed little Frenchman,
named Charles R&eacute;aume. Wisconsin was then a part of
Indiana Territory, of which William Henry Harrison
was governor. It was for the most part a wilderness;
dense woods and tenantless prairies extended all the
way from the narrow clearing at Green Bay to the
little settlement at Prairie du Chien. There were small
clearings at Portage, Milwaukee, and one or two other
fur trading posts. There was no civil government here,
and the few white people in all this vast stretch of
country practically made their own laws, each man
being judge and jury for himself, so long as he did
not interfere with other people's rights.</p>

<p>R&eacute;aume bore a commission from Governor Harrison,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
appointing him justice of the peace at Green Bay,
which meant nearly all of the country west of Lake
Michigan. Thus "Judge R&eacute;aume," as he was called,
was the only civil officer in Wisconsin, and although
apparently never reappointed, he retained this distinction
by popular consent until after the War of 1812-15;
indeed, for several years after that, he was the principal
officer of justice in these parts.</p>

<p>The judge was a good-hearted man, when one penetrated
beneath the crust of official pomposity with
which he was generally enveloped. He appears to
have owned a volume of Blackstone, but the only law
he understood or practiced was the old "Law of
Paris," which had governed Canada from the earliest
time, and which still rules in the Province of Quebec,
and it is related that he knew little of that. His decisions
were arbitrary, but were generally based on the
right as he saw it, quite regardless of the technicalities
of the law.</p>

<p>A great many queer stories are told of old Judge
R&eacute;aume. He loved display after his simple fashion,
and invented for himself an official uniform, which he
wore on all public occasions. This consisted of a scarlet
frock coat faced with white silk, and gay with spangled
buttons; it can still be seen in the museum of
the State Historical Society. He issued few warrants
or subp&oelig;nas; it is told of him that whenever he wanted
a person to appear before him, either as witness or
principal, he sent to that person the constable, bearing
his honor's well-known large jackknife, which was quite
as effectual as the king's signet ring of olden days.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p>Quite often did he adjudge guilty both complainant
and defendant, obliging them both to pay a fine, or to
work so many days in his garden; and sometimes both
were acquitted, the constable being ordered to pay the
costs. It is even said that the present of a bottle of
whisky to the judge was sufficient to insure a favorable
decision. The story is
told that once, when the
judge had actually rendered
a decision in a
certain case, the person
decided against
presented the court
with a new coffee-pot,
whereupon the judgment
was reversed.</p>

<p>There may be some
exaggeration in these
tales of the earliest
judge in Wisconsin, but
they appear to be in the
main substantiated. Nevertheless,
although there doubtless
was some grumbling, it speaks well for the old justice
of the peace, and for the orderly good nature of this
little French community without a jail, that no one appears
ever to have questioned the legality of R&eacute;aume's
decisions. These were strictly abided by, and although
he was never reappointed, he held office under both
American and British sway, simply because no one was
sent to succeed him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<p>Not only was R&eacute;aume Wisconsin's judge and jury
during the first two decades of the nineteenth century,
but as there was, during much of his time, no priest
hereabouts, he drew up marriage contracts, and married
and divorced people at will, issued baptismal certificates,
and kept a registry of births and deaths.
He certified alike to British and American military commissions;
drew up contracts between the fur traders
and their employees; wrote letters for the <i>habitants</i>;
and performed for the settlers all those functions of
Church and state for which we now require a long list
of officials and professional men. He was a picturesque
and important functionary, illustrating in his person the
simple fashions and modest desires of the French who
first settled this State. We are now a wealthier people,
but certainly there have never been happier times in
Wisconsin, all things considered, than in the primitive
days of old Judge R&eacute;aume and his official jackknife.</p>

<h2 id="THE_BRITISH_CAPTURE_PRAIRIE_DU_CHIEN">THE BRITISH CAPTURE PRAIRIE DU CHIEN</h2>

<p>Although the Northwest was obtained for the
United States by the treaty with Great Britain in
1783, the fur trade posts on the Upper Great Lakes
were openly held by the mother country until the new
republic could fully meet its financial obligations to her.
After thirteen years, a new treaty (1796) officially recognized
American supremacy. Nevertheless, for another
thirteen years English fur traders were practically in
possession of Wisconsin, operating through French
Canadian and half-breed agents, clerks, and <i>voyageurs</i>,
until John Jacob Astor (1809) organized the American
Fur Company, and English fur traders were forbidden
to operate here.</p>

<p>The military officers in Canada were firmly convinced
that the Americans could not long hold the Northwest.
They believed that some day there would be another
war, and the country would once more become the
property of Great Britain. Therefore they sought to
keep on good terms with our Indians and French, giving
them presents and employment.</p>

<p>Thus, when our second war with Great Britain did
break out, in 1812, nearly all the people living in Wisconsin,
and elsewhere in the wild northern parts of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
Northwest, were strong friends of the British cause.
To them the issue was very clear. British victory
meant the perpetuation of old times and old methods,
so dear to them and to their ancestors before them.
American victory meant the cutting down of the forests,
the death knell of the fur trade, and the coming of
a swarm of strange people, heretofore almost unknown
to Wisconsin. These people had been described to
them as an uneasy, selfish, land grabbing folk, who
knew not how to enjoy themselves, and were for turning
the world upside down with their Yankee notions.
Naturally, the easy-going, comfort loving Wisconsin
French looked upon their coming with great alarm.</p>

<p>The principal event of the war in Wisconsin was
the capture of Prairie du Chien by the British, in 1814.
Wisconsin was then a part of Illinois Territory, and
west of the Mississippi River lay the enormous Missouri
Territory. General William Clark, a younger
brother of George Rogers Clark, was governor of Missouri
Territory, and had in charge the conduct of military
operations along the Upper Mississippi River.</p>

<p>Governor Clark had heard that the British, by this
time strongly intrenched on Mackinac Island, intended
to send an expedition up the Fox River and down the
Wisconsin, to seize upon Prairie du Chien, which had
not been fortified since the old French days. Clark
recognized that the power that held Prairie du Chien
practically held the entire Upper Mississippi River, and
controlled the Indians and the fur trade of a vast region.
Accordingly, early in June (1814) he ascended the river
from his headquarters at St. Louis, with three hundred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
men in six or eight large boats, including a bullet-proof
keel boat, and erected a stockade on the summit of a
large Indian mound which lay on the bank of the Mississippi
a mile or two above the mouth of the Wisconsin.
The name given to this stockade was Fort Shelby.
Lieutenant Joseph Perkins was left in charge of the garrison,
which was divided between the fort and the keel
boat, the latter being anchored out in the Mississippi.</p>

<p>The British expedition from Mackinac had been
greatly delayed. During the preceding autumn, Robert
Dickson, an English fur trader, had been engaged
in recruiting a large band of Indians in the neighborhood
of Green Bay, and with them intended to occupy
Prairie du Chien. But the Indians were evidently
afraid to fight the Americans, and delayed Dickson so
that the canoes of his party were caught in the ice on
Lake Winnebago (December, 1813), and he was obliged
to go into winter quarters on Island Park (known to
the white pioneers as Garlic Island).</p>

<p>Poor Dickson had a sorry time with his war party.
As soon as it was learned that provisions were being
freely given out at this island camp, Indians from long
distances came to visit him, under pretense of enlisting
under the banner of the British chief. Councils
innumerable were held, presents and food had to be
given the visitors continually, and Dickson was put to
sore straits to keep them satisfied. He found it impossible
to get sufficient supplies from British headquarters
on Mackinac Island, and was being severely criticised
by the officers there, for his exorbitant demands upon
them. Nevertheless, unless he kept his Indians good-natured,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
they would promptly desert him. He was,
therefore, forced to rely upon the French of Green Bay
for what food he needed. This came grudgingly, and
at so high prices that Dickson roundly scolded the
Green Bay people, and promised to report them for
punishment to the British king, for daring to take
advantage of his Majesty's necessities.</p>

<p>While Dickson was thus engaged in Lake Winnebago,
a British captain was drilling a number of
young Frenchmen at Green Bay, and trying to make
soldiers of them; at Mackinac, a similar work was
being done among the <i>voyageurs</i> by the two leading
fur traders of Prairie du Chien, Brisbois and Rolette.
On the other hand, at Prairie du Chien, the American
Indian agent, Boilvin, was issuing circulars calling on
the people to claim American protection before it was
too late.</p>

<p>Late in June the leaders of the expedition started
from Mackinac, under the command of Major William
McKay, and at Green Bay, Lake Winnebago, and Portage
picked up various parties of French and Indians.
These bands were much reduced from those who had
been so liberally maintained during the winter, for
most of the Indians were anxious to keep away from
the fighting until it should be evident which side would
win, and many of the French were of the same mind.
By the time Fox River had been ascended by the fleet
of canoes, and the descent of the Wisconsin begun, the
allied forces consisted of but a hundred twenty whites
and four hundred fifty Indians. All of the latter, according
to McKay's report, proved "perfectly useless."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span></p>

<p>On the 17th of July, the British war party landed
at Prairie du Chien, to find the Americans, some sixty
or seventy strong, protected by a stockade and two
blockhouses, on which were mounted six small cannon.
In the river, the keel boat contained perhaps
seventy-five men and fourteen cannon. The British
had, besides their muskets, only a three-pounder, and
the situation did not look promising.</p>

<p>Perkins was summoned to surrender, but he declared
that he would "defend to the last man." For two days
there was a rather lively discharge of firearms on both
sides. Apparently, the British were the better gunners;
their cannonading soon forced the men on the
keel boat to desert their comrades on shore, and McKay
then centered his attention on the fort. The Indians
were unruly, being principally engaged in plundering
the Frenchmen's houses in the village. The British
supply of ammunition had quite run out by the evening
of the 9th, and McKay was seriously contemplating a
retreat, when he was surprised to see a white flag put
out by the garrison.</p>

<p>It appears that the stock of food had become exhausted
in the fort, and Perkins had formed an exaggerated
idea of the strength of the invaders. The
British guaranteed that the Americans should march
out of Fort Shelby at eight o'clock in the morning
of the 20th, with colors flying and with the honors of
war, and that the Indians should be prevented from
maltreating them. This last agreement McKay found
it very difficult to carry out, for the savages wished, as
usual, to massacre the prisoners. To the honor of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
British, it should be recorded that they exercised great
vigilance, and spared neither supplications nor threats,
to insure the safety
of their prisoners,
whom they soon sent
down the river to
the American post
at St. Louis.</p>

<p>When the British
flag was run up on
the stockade, the
name was changed
to Fort McKay, in
honor of the British
leader. During
the long autumn and succeeding
winter, the British experienced
their old difficulties with the
Indian allies. The warriors sacked
the houses of the French settlers, all
over the prairie, and destroyed crops and
supplies. Council after council was held at Fort
McKay, and large bands of lazy, quarrelsome savages,
encamped about the fort, were fed and were loaded
with presents; altogether, the occupation of Wisconsin
proved an expensive luxury. It was no doubt with
some relief that the British garrison at last learned,
late in May 1815, of the treaty of peace signed on
the previous 24th of December, and made arrangements
to withdraw up the Wisconsin and down the
Fox, and across the great lake to Mackinac.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>

<p>In point of fact, the withdrawal of Captain Bulger, at
that time in charge of Fort McKay, was in reality a
hasty and undignified retreat from his own allies. The
Indians had learned with amazement that the British
palefaces were going to surrender to the American
palefaces, without showing fight, and simply because
somewhere, far away in another part of the world, some
other palefaces, whom these Englishmen had never
even seen, had held a peace council and buried the
hatchet. This sort of thing could not be understood by
the savages encamped outside the walls of Fort McKay,
save as an evidence of rank cowardice. They called the
redcoats a lot of "old women," became insolent, and
even threatened them.</p>

<p>Captain Bulger saw that it would not do to await the
arrival of the American troops from St. Louis, so he
sent an Indian messenger with a letter to the American
commander, telling him to help himself to everything in
Fort McKay. Then, only forty-eight hours after the
arrival of the peace news, he pulled down his flag and
hurried home as fast as he could, fearful all the way
that an Indian war party might be at his heels. Thus
ignominiously ended the last British occupation of Wisconsin.</p>

</div>

<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span></p>

<h2 id="THE_STORY_OF_THE_WISCONSIN_LEAD_MINES">THE STORY OF THE WISCONSIN LEAD MINES</h2>

<p>It was the fur trade that first brought white men to
Wisconsin. The daring Nicolet pushed his way
through the wilderness, a thousand miles west of the
little French settlement at Quebec, solely to introduce
the traffic in furs to our savages, and others were not
long in following him. Soon it was learned that there
were lead mines in what is now southwest Wisconsin.</p>

<p>It is not probable that the aborigines, before the
coming of white men, made any other use of lead
than from it to fashion a few rude ornaments. But
the French at once recognized the great value of this
mineral, in connection with the fur trade. They taught
the Indians how to mine it in a crude fashion, and to
make it into bullets for the guns which they introduced
among them.</p>

<p>The French traders themselves mined a good deal of
it for their own use, and shipped it in their canoes to
other parts of the West, where there were no lead
mines, but where both white men and Indians needed
bullets. For in a remarkably short period nearly all
the Indians had turned from their old pursuits of raising
maize and pumpkins, and killing just enough game<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
with slings and arrows to supply themselves with skins
for their clothing and flesh for their food. They had
now become persistent hunters for skins, which they
might exchange with white men for European-made
guns, ammunition, kettles, spears, cloths, and ornaments.</p>

<p>Some of the Indians in the neighborhood of the
lead mines found it more profitable to mine lead for
other hunters, than to hunt; hence we find that, at
an early date, the mines came to be regarded as the
particular property of the Indians, a fact which had
considerable influence upon the history of the region.
With the French, most of our Wisconsin Indians were
quite friendly. The French were kind and obliging,
often married and settled among them, and had no
thought of driving them away. They throve upon the
fur trade with the Indians, and in general did not care
to become farmers. The English and the Americans,
on the contrary, felt a contempt for the savages, and
did not disguise it; the aim of the Americans, in particular,
was gradually to clear the forest, to make farms,
and to build villages. In the American scheme of civilization
the Indian had no part. Therefore we find
that Frenchmen were quite free to work the lead mines
in company with the savages; but the Anglo-Saxons,
when they arrived on the scene, were obliged to fight
for this right. In the end they banished the Indians
from the "diggings."</p>

<p>Marquette and Joliet had heard of the lead mines,
and of the Frenchmen working at them, when they made
their famous canoe trip through Wisconsin, in 1673.
Through the rest of the seventeenth century, wherever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
we pick up any French books of travel in these regions,
or any maps of the Upper Mississippi country, we are
sure to find frequent, though rather vague, mention of
the lead mines.</p>

<p>The first official exploration of them appears to have
been made in 1693 by Le Sueur, the French military
commandant at Chequamegon Bay, on Lake Superior.
He was so impressed by the "mines of lead, copper,
and blue and green earth" which he found all along
the banks of the Upper Mississippi, that he went to
France to tell the king about his great discoveries, and
seek permission to work them. It was forbidden to
do anything in New France without the consent of the
great French king, although the free and independent
fur traders did very much as they pleased out here in
the wilderness. But Le Sueur was a soldier, and had
to ask permission. Obtaining it, he returned at great
expense with thirty miners, who proceeded up the
Mississippi from New Orleans; but somehow nothing
came of these extensive preparations.</p>

<p>Several French speculators, in succeeding years,
thought to make money out of supposed mines of gold,
silver, lead, and copper along the upper waters of the
Mississippi. Some of them came over from France
with bands of miners and little companies of soldiers
to guard them; but, like Le Sueur, they spent most of
their time and money in exploration, not content with
those lead mines that were well known to exist, and
invariably left the country in disgust, their money and
patience exhausted. Now and then a more practical
man came quietly upon the scene, and seemed well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
satisfied with lead when he could not find gold; most
of such miners were French, but a few were Spanish,
for Spain then owned all the country lying westward
of the Mississippi River.</p>

quantity of the ore, and take it home with him in his
fleet of canoes; or a fur trader would do the same, for
the purposes of his own trade with the savages. The
little French village of Ste. Genevi&egrave;ve, near St. Louis,
had become, by the opening of our Revolutionary War,
a considerable lead market, from which shipments were
made in flatboats and bateaux down the Mississippi to
New Orleans, or up the Ohio to Pittsburg. Lead was,
next to peltries, the most important export of the Upper
Mississippi region, and throughout the West served as
currency.</p>

<p>During the Revolutionary War, the British were at
first in command of the upper reaches of the great
river, and guarded jealously the approach to the lead
mines, for bullets were necessary to the success of the
fast growing Kentucky settlements; American military
operations against the little British garrisons at Vincennes,
Kaskaskia, Cahokia, and Detroit would be
powerless without lead. Gradually the influence of
the American fur trade grew among the Indians, and
it was not long before the Americans in the West were
able to obtain through them all the lead they wanted.</p>

<p>Toward the close of the war, Julien Dubuque, a very
energetic French miner, bought up large claims from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
the Spaniards, in Missouri and Iowa, and for about a
quarter of a century was the principal man in the lead
region. He was remarkably successful in dealing with
the Indians, whom he employed to do the principal
work. His mining and trading operations were not
confined to the Spanish side of the river, but were carried
on in American territory as well, and his influence
with the savages for a time prevented American miners
and fur traders from obtaining a foothold.</p>

<p>When at last (1804) the United States obtained possession
of the lands west of the Mississippi, numerous
enterprising Americans forced their way into the lead
district. They managed to mine a good deal of the
metal, here and there, but frequently met with armed
opposition from the Indians. It was fifteen years
before the Americans equaled the French Canadians
in number. In 1819, the Indian claims to the mining
country having at last been purchased by the federal
government, there was a general inrush of Americans.
Among the earliest and most prominent of these was
James W. Shull, the founder of Shullsburg, in Iowa
county. Another man of note was Colonel James Johnson,
of Kentucky, who brought negro slaves into the
region, to do his heaviest labor, and maintained a fleet
of flatboats to carry lead ore from Galena River to
St. Louis, New Orleans, and Pittsburg.</p>

<p>At first the operations of Johnson, Shull, and others
had to be carried on under military protection; for
the Indians, although they had sold their claims, persisted
in annoying the newcomers, being urged on by
the French miners and traders who were still numerous
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
in the mining country. But so soon as the news
spread that a large trade in lead was fast springing
up, other Americans began to pour in; mining claims
were entered in great numbers, a federal land office was
opened, and by 1826 two thousand men, including negro
slaves brought in by Kentucky and Missouri operators,
were engaged in and about the mines. The following
year the town of Galena was founded, and in 1829
there was a stampede thither.</p>

<p>Henceforth, for many years, the lead trade of southwestern
Wisconsin, northwestern Illinois, and parts of
Missouri and Iowa was the chief interest in the West.
By this time the fur trade had almost died out, and
the old French Canadian element had become but a
small proportion of the population of the Mississippi
valley. In those days, Galena, Mineral Point, and
other lead mining towns were of much more importance
than Chicago or Milwaukee, and their citizens entertained
high hopes of the future. The lead trade with
St. Louis and New Orleans was very large; but the
East also wanted the lead, and the air was filled with
projects to secure routes by which lead might be carried
to vessels plying on the Great Lakes, which could
transport it to Buffalo and other far away ports.</p>

<p>For a time the most popular of these projects was
the old fur trade route of the Wisconsin and Fox rivers.
A canal was dug along the famous carrying trail at
Portage, and the federal government was induced to
deepen Fox River, which is naturally very shallow, and
to attempt to create a permanent channel in the Wisconsin
River. But, although much money has been
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
spent on these schemes, from that day to this, the Fox-Wisconsin
route is still impracticable save to boats of
exceptionally light draft; and in our time the project
of connecting the Mississippi River with Lake Michigan,
by the way of Portage and Green Bay, is almost
wholly abandoned. Another scheme was the proposed
Milwaukee and Rock River canal, by which Milwaukee
was to be connected with the Rock River, which joins
the Mississippi at Rock Island; but this plan died a
still earlier death. It was the struggle to connect the
port of Milwaukee with the lead region that
finally led to the building of the railroad
between that city and Prairie du Chien.</p>

<p>More immediately effective for the
benefit of the lead trade, was the
opening of a wagon road
from the lead mining
towns, through Madison, to Milwaukee, along which
great canvas-covered caravans of ore-laden "prairie
schooners" toiled slowly from the mines to the Lake
Michigan docks, a distance of about a hundred and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
fifty miles. Other roads led to Galena and Prairie
du Chien, where the Mississippi River boats awaited
similar fleets of "schooners" from the interior. A
good deal of the lead was sent by similar conveyances
to Helena, a little village on the Wisconsin River,
where a shot tower had been built against the face of a
high cliff; from here, shallow-draft boats took the shot
to Green Bay, by way of the Portage Canal and Fox
River, or descended the Wisconsin to Prairie du Chien.</p>

<p>From various causes, the lead trade of the Upper
Mississippi region had sadly declined by 1857. Among
these causes was the finding of gold in California
(1849), which attracted large numbers of the miners
to a more profitable field; again, the surface or shallow
diggings having been exhausted, much more capital
was required to operate in the lower levels; more
serious was the lack of sufficient transportation facilities,
and these did not come until the great silver
mines of the Rocky Mountains had been opened, lead
being thenceforth more profitably produced in connection
with silver.</p>

<p>The effect of the lead industry upon the development
of Wisconsin was important. Many years before farmers
would naturally have sought southern Wisconsin in
their pushing westward for fresh lands, the opening of
the mines brought thither a large and energetic industrial
population, and a considerable capital, and awakened
popular interest in land and water transportation
routes.</p>

<h2 id="THE_WINNEBAGO_WAR">THE WINNEBAGO WAR</h2>

<p>The world over, white men, representing a higher
type of civilization, have wrested, or are still wresting,
the land from the original savage occupants. This
seems to be inevitable. It is one of the means by
which civilization is being extended over the entire
globe. We glory in the progress of civilization; but we
are apt to ignore the hardship which this brings to the
aborigines. While not relaxing our endeavor to plant
the world with progressive men who shall make the
most of life, we should see to it that the savage races
are pushed to the wall with as kindly and forbearing a
hand as possible; that we apply to them humane
methods, and give them credit for possessing the sentiments
of men who, like us, dearly love their old homes,
and are willing to fight for them. These sentiments
have certainly not often been applied in the past, by
our Anglo-Saxon race, to the Indians of North America.</p>

<div>
<img src="images/image129.jpg" width="200" height="552" class="splitr" alt="" />
</div>

<p>We have failed to appreciate that the Indian, in being
driven from his lands, has retaliated from motives of
patriotism. His methods of fighting are often cruel
and treacherous; but it must be remembered that he is
in a stage of development akin to that of the child, and
that white men upon the frontier have often been quite
as cruel and treacherous toward the Indian as he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
toward them, for such are ever the methods of the weak
and the primitive. The Indian is blamed for his custom
of wreaking vengeance upon all white men, when but
an individual has injured him; yet, on the border, it has
always been seen that white men have retaliated on the
Indians in exactly the same spirit. "The only good
Indian is a dead Indian," has been their motto, the
offense of one Indian being considered the offense of
all. Our dealings with the red men, both as individuals
and as a nation, have, for over a hundred years, often
been such as we should blush for. We are doing better
now than formerly; but our treatment of the weak
and unfortunate aborigines is still far from being to
our credit.</p>

<p>The story of the Winnebago War, in Wisconsin, is
illustrative of the old-time method of treating our barbaric
predecessors. No doubt it would have been better
if the United States had, from the first, held all the
Indians to be subjects, and forced them to obey our
laws. But the tribes were considered in theory to be
distinct nations, over whom we exercised supervision,
and with whom we held treaties. This at first seemed
necessary, owing to the patriarchal system among the
Indians, by which heads of families or clans are supposed
to control the younger members, all affairs
being decided upon in councils, in which these wise old
men participate. It was thought that, through the
chiefs, binding agreements could be made with entire
tribes. It was not then generally understood that each
Indian is, according to the customs of those people,
really a law unto himself; that the chiefs, in signing a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
treaty, are seldom representative in the sense that we
use the word, and that they generally represent no one
but themselves; that the only way in which they can
commit their tribes is through the respect or fear which
they may foster in the minds of their followers.</p>

<p>In the month of August, 1825, when Wisconsin was
still a part of Michigan Territory, there was a treaty
signed at Prairie du Chien between the United States
and the Indians of what are now Illinois, Wisconsin,
and Minnesota. The treaty set boundaries between the
quarrelsome tribes, and agreed on a general peace upon
the border. Like most Indian treaties, this document
was drawn up by the officers of the general government;
and the chiefs, knowing little of its contents,
were simply invited to sign their names to it. They
signed as requested, but went home in bad temper,
because the American commissioners would not make
them costly presents of guns, ammunition, beads, hatchets,
cloths, and rum, as the British in Canada always
did; and the savages were not even allowed to celebrate
the treaty by a roistering feast. The Americans,
from their cold, businesslike conduct, impressed the
Indians as being "stingy old women."</p>

<p>Nobody on the frontier, the following winter, seemed
to pay the slightest attention to the terms of the treaty.
The Sioux, who lived west of the Mississippi, the Winnebagoes
in southern and western Wisconsin, and the
Chippewas in the north, quarreled with one another and
scalped one another as freely as ever; while French
traders, in British employ, stirred up the red men, and
told them that Great Britain would soon have the whole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
country back again. The Winnebagoes, in particular,
were irritated because two of their braves had been
imprisoned for thieving, at Fort Crawford, in Prairie
du Chien. They held numerous councils in the woods,
and resolved to stand by the British when the war
should break out. In the midst of this uneasiness,
the troops at Fort Crawford were suddenly withdrawn
to Fort Snelling, on the Upper Mississippi River, near
where St. Paul now is. This was supposed by the
Indians to mean that the American soldiers were afraid
of them.</p>

<p>The spring of 1827 arrived. A half-breed named
Methode was making maple sugar upon the Yellow
River, in Iowa, a dozen miles north of Prairie du Chien.
With him were his wife and five children; all were set
upon by some Winnebagoes and killed, scalped, and
burned. Naturally there was an uproar all along the
Upper Mississippi. Excitement was at its height, when
word was brought in by Sioux visitors to the village of
Red Bird, a petty Winnebago chief, that the two men
of his tribe who had been imprisoned in Fort Crawford
had been hung when the troops reached Fort Snelling.
The wily Sioux suggested vengeance. The Winnebago
code was two lives for one. Inflamed with rage, Red
Bird set out at once upon the warpath to take four
white scalps.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the clouds were gathering for a general
storm. The American Indian agent at Prairie du Chien,
with singular indiscretion, was not treating his Winnebago
visitors with kindness. English and French fur
traders were, on behalf of Great Britain, making liberal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
promises for the future. Winnebagoes were being
brutally driven from the lead mines by the white miners,
who were now swarming into southwest Wisconsin.
The Sioux along the west bank of the Mississippi, in
Minnesota, were encouraging the Winnebagoes to revolt;
and were displaying a bad temper
toward Americans, whom they thought
cowardly because apparently unwilling
to use military force to keep the Indians
in order.</p>

<div id="i13319">&nbsp;</div>

<p>One day in June, Red Bird, a friend
named Wekau, and two other Winnebagoes,
appeared at the door of a log
cabin owned by Registre Gagnier, a
French settler living on the edge of
Prairie du Chien village. Gagnier was
an old friend of Red Bird, and invited
the four Indians in to take dinner with
him and his family. For several hours
the guests stayed, eating and smoking
in apparent good humor, until at last
their chance came. Gagnier and his
serving man, Lipcap, were instantly shot
down; an infant of eighteen months was
torn from the arms of Madame Gagnier, stabbed
and scalped before her eyes, and thrown to the floor
as dead; but the woman herself with her little boy,
ten years of age, escaped to the woods and gave the
alarm to the neighbors. The Indians slunk into the
forest and disappeared. The villagers buried Gagnier
and Lipcap, and, finding the infant girl alive, restored<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
her to her mother. Curiously enough, the scalped
child recovered and grew to robust womanhood.</p>

<p>According to the Winnebago code, four white scalps
must be taken in return for the two Indians supposed
to have been killed at Fort Snelling. Red Bird had
now secured three, those of Gagnier, Lipcap, and the
infant; a fourth was necessary before he could properly
return to his people in the capacity of an avenger, the
proudest title which an Indian can bear. How he
obtained these scalps was, to the mind of his race,
unimportant; the one idea was to get them.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the third day after the massacre,
Red Bird and his friends were visiting at a camp of
their people, near the mouth of the Bad Ax River, some
forty miles north of Prairie du Chien. A drunken
feast was in progress, in honor of the scalp taking,
when two keel boats appeared on their way down the
Mississippi from Fort Snelling to St. Louis. The Sioux,
at what is now Winona, had threatened the crews, but
had not attempted to harm them. The Winnebagoes
now appeared on the bank and raised the war whoop,
but the crew of the foremost boat thought it only
bluster, so in a spirit of bravado ran their craft toward
shore. When it was within thirty yards of the bank,
the Indians, led by Red Bird, poured a volley of rifle
balls into the boat. The crew were well armed, and,
rushing below, answered by shooting through the portholes.
The boat ran on a bar, and a sharp fire lasted
through three hours, until dusk, when the craft was
finally worked off the bar, and dropped downstream in
the dark. Although seven hundred bullets penetrated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
the hull, only two of the crew were killed outright, two
others dying later from wounds, and two others were
slightly wounded. The Indians lost seven killed and
fourteen wounded.</p>

<p>The "battle of the keel boats" was the signal for
military activity. In July a battalion of troops from
Fort Snelling came down to Prairie du Chien; and a
little later a full regiment from St. Louis followed.
General Henry Atkinson was in command, and early
in August he ordered Major William Whistler, then in
charge of Fort Howard, to proceed up Fox River with
a company of troops, in search of the fugitives Red
Bird and Wekau. At a council held with the Winnebagoes,
at Butte des Morts, the chiefs were notified
that nothing short of the surrender of the leaders of
the disturbance would satisfy the government for the
attack on the boats; were they not delivered up, the
entire tribe should be hunted like wild animals.</p>

<p>Great consternation prevailed among the tribesmen,
as the runners sent out from the Butte des Morts
council carried the terrible threat to all the camps of
the Winnebagoes, in the deep forests, in the pleasant
oak groves, and upon the broad prairies throughout
southern Wisconsin. Whistler had reached the ridge
flanking the old portage trail between the Fox and
Wisconsin rivers, but had not fully completed the
arrangements of his camp when an Indian runner appeared
in hot haste, saying that Red Bird and Wekau
would surrender themselves at three o'clock in the
afternoon of the following day, that the tribe might be
saved.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span></p>

<p>Whistler and his officers, as true soldiers, were
prompt to appreciate bravery. They were broad
enough to judge these savages by the standards of
savagery, not by those of a civilization from which
the Indian is removed by centuries of human progress.
They knew full well that the culprits were but carrying
out the law of their race in seeking white scalps in
vengeance for the Winnebagoes supposed to have been
slain at Fort Snelling. Whistler knew that the Indians
considered Red Bird and Wekau as heroes, and could
feel no pangs of conscience, because treachery toward
enemies was the customary method of Indian warfare.
Realizing these facts, the American officers recognized
that it required a fine type of heroism on the part of
these simple natives thus to offer themselves up to
probable death, to redeem their tribe from destruction.</p>

<p>For this reason the soldiers were brought out on
parade; and when, prompt to the hour named, Red
Bird and Wekau, accompanied by a party of their
friends, came marching into camp, clad in ceremonial
dress, and singing their death songs, they were received
with military honors. The native ceremony of surrender
was highly impressive. Red Bird conducted himself
with a dignity which won the admiration of all.
Wekau, on the contrary, was an indifferent looking
fellow, and commanded little respect.</p>

<p>Red Bird made but one request, that, although sentenced
to death, he should not be placed in chains.
This was granted; and while, during his subsequent
imprisonment at Prairie du Chien, he had frequent opportunities
to escape, he declined to take advantage of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
them. A few months later he fell an easy victim
to an epidemic then raging in the village, thus
relieving the government from embarrassment,
for it was felt that he was altogether
too good an Indian to hang; indeed,
his execution might have brought on
a general border war.</p>

<p>The murderers of Methode were
also apprehended and given
a death sentence; but upon
the Winnebagoes promising
to relinquish forever
their hold upon the lead
mines of southwestern
Wisconsin and northwestern
Illinois, President
Adams pardoned all the
prisoners then living. The
following year (1828), a fort
was erected at the Fox-Wisconsin portage, near the
scene of Red Bird's surrender; being in the heart of
that tribe's territory, it was called Fort Winnebago.
Thereafter the Winnebagoes were kept in entire subjection.
Indeed, the three forts, Howard at Green
Bay, Winnebago at Portage, and Crawford at Prairie
du Chien, now gave the United States, for the first
time, firm grasp upon the whole of what is now Wisconsin.</p>

<h2 id="THE_BLACK_HAWK_WAR">THE BLACK HAWK WAR</h2>

<p>In November, 1804, the Sac and Fox Indians, in
return for a paltry annuity of a thousand dollars,
ceded to the United States fifty million acres of land
in eastern Missouri, northwestern Illinois, and southwestern
Wisconsin. There was an unfortunate clause
in this compact, which quite unexpectedly became one
of the chief causes of the Black Hawk War of 1832;
instead of obliging the Indians at once to vacate the
ceded territory, it was stipulated that, "as long as the
lands which are now ceded to the United States remain
their property, the Indians belonging to said
tribes shall enjoy the privilege of living and hunting
on them."</p>

<p>Within the limits of the cession was the chief seat
of Sac power, a village lying on the north side of
Rock River, three miles above its mouth. It was
picturesquely situated on fertile ground, contained the
principal cemetery of the tribe, and was inhabited by
about five hundred families, being one of the largest
Indian towns on the continent.</p>

<p>From the beginning of the nineteenth century, the
principal character in this village was Black Hawk,
who was born here in 1767. Black Hawk was neither<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
an hereditary nor an elected chief, but was, by common
consent, the village headman. He was a restless,
ambitious, handsome savage; was possessed of
some of the qualities of successful leadership, was
much of a demagogue, and aroused the passions of
his people by appeals to their prejudices and superstitions.
It is probable that he was never, in the exercise
of this policy, dishonest
in his motives. A
too confiding disposition
was ever leading his judgment
astray; he was readily
duped by those who,
white or red, were interested
in deceiving him.
The effect of his daily
communication with the
Americans was often to
shock rudely his high
sense of honor; while the
studied courtesy accorded
him upon his annual begging
visit to the British military agent at Malden, in
Canada, contrasted strangely, in his eyes, with his
experiences with many of the inhabitants on the Illinois
border.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
BLACK HAWK
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>

<p>At the outbreak of hostilities between Great Britain
and the United States in 1812, Black Hawk naturally
allied himself with Tecumseh and the British. After
burying the hatchet, he settled down into the customary
routine of savage life, hunting in winter and loafing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
about his village in summer, improvidently existing
from hand to mouth, although surrounded with abundance.
Occasionally he varied the monotony by visits
to Malden, whence he would return laden with provisions,
arms, ammunition, and trinkets, his stock of
vanity increased by wily flattery, and his bitterness
against the Americans correspondingly intensified. It
is not at all surprising that he hated the Americans.
They brought him naught but evil. The even tenor
of his life was continually being disturbed by them;
and a cruel and causeless beating which some white
settlers gave him, in the winter of 1822-23, was an
insult which he treasured up against the entire American
people.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1823, squatters, covetous of the
rich fields cultivated by the "British band," as Black
Hawk's people were often called, began to take possession
of them. The treaty of 1804 had guaranteed
to the Indians the use of the ceded territory so long
as the lands remained the property of the United
States and were not sold to individuals. The frontier
line of homestead settlement was still fifty or sixty
miles to the east; the country between had not yet
been surveyed, and much of it not explored. The
squatters had no rights in this territory, and it was
clearly the duty of the general government to protect
the Indians within it so long as no sales were
made.</p>

<p>The Sacs would not have complained had the squatters
settled in other portions of the tract, and not
sought to steal the village which was their birthplace<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
and contained the cemetery of their tribe. There were
outrages of the most flagrant nature. Indian cornfields
were fenced in by the intruders, squaws and children
were whipped for venturing beyond the bounds thus
set, lodges were burned over the heads of the occupants.
A reign of terror ensued, in which the frequent
remonstrances of Black Hawk to the white
authorities were in vain. Year by year the evil grew.
When the Indians returned each spring from the
winter's hunt, they found their village more of a
wreck than when they had left it in the fall. It is
surprising, in view of their native love of revenge,
that they acted so peaceably while the victims of
such harsh treatment.</p>

<p>Returning to his village in the spring of 1831, after a
gloomy and profitless winter's hunt, Black Hawk was
fiercely warned away by the whites; but, in a firm and
dignified manner, he notified the settlers that, if they
did not themselves remove, he should use force. This
announcement was construed by the whites as a threat
against their lives. Petitions and messages were showered
in by them upon Governor John Reynolds, of Illinois,
setting forth the situation in exaggerated terms
that would be amusing, were it not that they were the
prelude to one of the darkest tragedies in the history of
our Western border.</p>

<p>The governor caught the spirit of the occasion, and
at once issued a flaming proclamation calling out a
mounted volunteer force to "repel the invasion of the
British band." These volunteers, sixteen hundred
strong, co&ouml;perated with ten companies of regulars in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
demonstration before Black Hawk's village on the
25th of June. During that night the Indians, in the
face of this superior force, quietly withdrew to the west
bank of the Mississippi, whither they had previously
been ordered. On the 30th they signed a treaty of capitulation
and peace, solemnly agreeing never to return
to the east side of the river without express permission
of the United States government.</p>

<p>The rest of the summer was spent by the evicted
savages in a state of misery. It being now too late to
raise another crop of corn and beans, they suffered
for want of the actual necessaries of life. White Cloud,
the eloquent and crafty Prophet of the Winnebagoes,
was Black Hawk's evil genius. He was half Sac and
half Winnebago, a hater of the whites, an inveterate
mischief maker, and, being a "medicine man," possessed
much influence over both tribes. He was at the
head of a Winnebago village some thirty-five miles
above the mouth of the Rock, on the east side of the
Mississippi; and to this village he invited Black Hawk,
advising him to raise a crop of corn there, with the
assurance that in the autumn the Winnebagoes and
Pottawattomies would join him in a general movement
against the whites in the valley of the Rock.</p>

<p>Relying on these rose-colored promises, Black Hawk
spent the winter on the west bank of the Mississippi,
recruiting his band, and on the 6th of April, 1832,
crossed the great river at Yellow Banks, below the
mouth of the Rock. Thus he invaded the State of
Illinois, in the face of his solemn treaty of the year
before. With him were his second in command, Neapope,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
a wily scoundrel, who was White Cloud's tool,
and about five hundred Sac warriors with their women
and children, and all their belongings. Their design
was to carry out the advice of the Prophet, in regard
to the corn planting, and if possible to take up the
hatchet in the autumn.</p>

<p>But it became evident to Black Hawk, before he
reached the Prophet's town, that the main body of the
Pottawattomies, now controlled by the peace loving
Chief Shaubena, did not intend to go to war; and that
the rascally Winnebagoes, while cajoling him, were
preparing as usual to play double. He tells us in his
autobiography that, crestfallen, he was planning to return
peacefully to the west side of the Mississippi, when
of a sudden he became aware that the whites had raised
an army against him, and he was confronted with a war
not in the time and manner of his asking.</p>

<p>The news of his second invasion had spread like wildfire
throughout the Illinois and Wisconsin settlements.
The United States was appealed to for a regiment of
troops; and meanwhile, under another fiery proclamation
from the governor of Illinois, an army of eighteen
hundred militiamen was quickly mustered. Amid intense
popular excitement, during which many settlers
fled from the country, and others hastily threw up log
forts, the army was mobilized by General Atkinson,
who appeared at the rendezvous with three hundred
regulars. There were many notable men upon this expedition:
Abraham Lincoln, then a rawboned young
fellow, was captain of a company of Illinois rangers;
Zachary Taylor, famous for his bluff manner, was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
colonel of regulars; and Jefferson Davis, who was wooing
Taylor's daughter, was one of his lieutenants; also
of the regulars, was Major William S. Harney, afterward
the hero of Cerro Gordo in the Mexican War;
and the mustering-in officer was Lieutenant Robert
Anderson, who was to become famous in connection
with Fort Sumter.</p>

<p>Black Hawk was foolish enough to send a message
of defiance to General Atkinson, and, retreating up the
Rock, he came to a stand at Stillman's Creek. Here
he repented, and sent out runners with a flag of truce,
to inform the white chief that he would surrender; but
the drunken pickets of the militia advance wantonly
killed these messengers of peace. This so angered the
Hawk that with a mere handful of thirty-five braves,
on foot, and hid in the hazel brush, he turned in fury
upon the two hundred seventy-five horsemen who
were now rushing upon him. The cowardly rangers,
who fled at the first volley of the savages, without returning
it, were haunted by the genius of fear, and,
dashing madly through swamps and creeks, did not
stop until they had reached Dixon, twenty-five miles
away. Many kept on at a keen gallop till they
reached their own firesides, fifty or more miles farther,
carrying the absurd report that Black Hawk and two
thousand bloodthirsty warriors were sweeping northern
Illinois with the besom of destruction.</p>

<p>Rich in supplies captured in this first encounter, and
naturally encouraged at the result of his valor, the
Hawk thought that so long as the whites were determined
to make him fight, he would show his claws in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
earnest. Removing the women and children to far-away
swamps on the headwaters of the Rock River,
in Wisconsin, he thence descended with his braves for
a general raid through northern Illinois. The borderers
flew like chickens to cover, on the warning of
the Hawk's foray. There was consternation throughout
the entire West. Exaggerated reports of his forces,
and of the nature of his expedition, were spread throughout
the land. His name became coupled with fabulous
tales of savage cunning and cruelty, and served as a
household bugaboo the country over. The effect on
the Illinois militia was singular enough, considering
their haste in taking the field; in a frenzy of fear,
they instantly disbanded!</p>

<p>A fresh levy was soon raised, but in the interval
there were irregular hostilities all along the Illinois-Wisconsin
border, in which Black Hawk and a few
Winnebago and Pottawattomie allies succeeded in making
life miserable enough for the frontier farmers of
northern Illinois and the lead miners of southwest
Wisconsin. In these border strifes fully two hundred
whites and nearly as many Indians lost their lives; and
there were numerous instances of romantic heroism on
the part of the settlers, men and women alike.</p>

<p>In about three weeks after Stillman's defeat the reorganized
militia took the field, re&euml;nforced by the regulars
under Atkinson. Black Hawk was forced to fly to the
swampy region of the upper Rock; but, when the pursuit
became too warm, he hastily withdrew with his
entire band westward to the Wisconsin River. Closely
following upon his trail were a brigade of Illinois troops<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
under General James D. Henry, and a battalion of Wisconsin
lead mine rangers under Major Henry Dodge,
afterwards governor of Wisconsin Territory.</p>

<p>The pursuers came up with the savages at Prairie du
Sac. Here the south bank of the Wisconsin consists of
steep, grassy bluffs, three hundred feet in height; hence
the encounter which ensued is known in history as the
Battle of the Wisconsin Heights. With consummate
skill, Black Hawk made a stand on the summit of the
heights, and with a small party of warriors held the
whites in check until the noncombatants had crossed
the broad river bottoms below, and gained shelter upon
the willow-grown shore opposite. The loss on either
side was slight, the action being notable only for the
Sac leader's superior management.</p>

<p>During the night, the passage of the river was accomplished
by the fugitives. A large party was sent
downstream upon a raft, and in canoes begged from
the Winnebagoes; but those who took this method of
escape were brutally fired upon near the mouth of the
river by a detachment from the garrison at Prairie du
Chien, and fifteen were killed in cold blood. The rest
of the pursued, headed by Black Hawk, who had again
made an attempt to surrender his forces, but had failed
for lack of an interpreter, pushed across country,
guided by Winnebagoes, to the mouth of the Bad Ax,
a little stream emptying into the Mississippi about forty
miles above the mouth of the Wisconsin River. His
intention was to get his people as quickly as possible
on the west bank of the Mississippi, in the hope that
they would there be allowed to remain in peace.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span></p>

<p>The Indians were followed, three days behind, by the
united army of regulars, who steadily gained on them.
The country between Wisconsin Heights and the Mississippi
is rough and forbidding in character; there are
numerous swamps and rivers between the steep, thickly
wooded hills. The uneven pathway was strewn with
the corpses of Sacs who had died of wounds and starvation;
and there were frequent evidences that the fleeing
wretches were sustaining life on the bark of trees
and the flesh of their fagged-out ponies.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/image143.jpg" width="600" height="443"  alt="" />
</div>

<p>On Wednesday, the 1st of August, Black Hawk
and his now sadly depleted and almost famished band
reached the junction of the Bad Ax with the Mississippi.
There were only two or three canoes to be had,
and the crossing of the Father of Waters progressed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
slowly and with frequent loss of life. That afternoon
there appeared upon the scene a government supply
steamer, the <i>Warrior</i>, from Fort Crawford (Prairie du
Chien), at the mouth of the Wisconsin. The Indians a
third time tried to surrender, but their white flag was
deliberately fired at, and round after round of canister
swept the camp.</p>

<p>The next day the pursuing troops arrived on the
heights above the river bench, the <i>Warrior</i> again
opened its attack, and thus, caught between two galling
fires, the little army of savages soon melted away.
But fifty remained alive on the spot to be taken prisoners.
Some three hundred weaklings had reached the
Iowa shore through the hail of iron and lead. Of these
three hundred helpless, half-starved, unarmed noncombatants,
over a half were slaughtered by a party of
Sioux, under Wabashaw, who had been sent out by
our government to waylay them. So that out of the
band of a thousand Indians who had crossed the Mississippi
over into Illinois in April, not more than a
hundred and fifty, all told, lived to tell the tragic story
of the Black Hawk War, a tale that stains the American
name with dishonor.</p>

<p>The rest can soon be told. The Winnebago guerrillas,
who had played fast and loose during the campaign,
delivered to the whites at Fort Crawford the
unfortunate Black Hawk, who had fled from the Bad
Ax to the Dells of the Wisconsin River, to seek an
asylum with his false friends. The proud old man,
shorn of all his strength, was presented to the President
at Washington, imprisoned in Fortress Monroe,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
forced to sign articles of perpetual peace, and then
turned over for safe keeping to the Sac chief, Keokuk,
his hated rival. He died on a small reservation in
Iowa, in 1838. But he was not even then at peace,
for his bones were stolen by an Illinois physician, for
exhibition purposes, and finally were accidentally consumed
by fire in 1853.</p>

<p>Black Hawk, with all the limitations of his race, had
in his character a strength and manliness of fiber that
were most remarkable, and displayed throughout his
brief campaign a positive genius for military evolutions.
He may be safely ranked as one of the most interesting
specimens of the North American savage to be met
with in history. He was an indiscreet man. His
troubles were brought about by a lack of mental balance,
aided largely by unfortunate circumstances. His
was a highly romantic temperament. He was carried
away by mere sentiment, and allowed himself to be
deceived by tricksters. But he was honest, and was
more honorable than many of his conquerors were.
He was, above all things, a patriot. The year before
his death, in a speech to a party of whites who were
making a holiday hero of him, he thus forcibly defended
his motives: "Rock River was a beautiful country. I
liked my town, my cornfields, and the home of my
people. I fought for them." No poet could have
penned for him a more touching epitaph.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<h2 id="THE_STORY_OF_CHEQUAMEGON_BAY">THE STORY OF CHEQUAMEGON BAY</h2>

<p>Chequamegon Bay, of Lake Superior, has
had a long and an interesting history. Nearly
two and a half centuries ago, in the early winter
months of 1659, two adventurous French traders,
Radisson and Groseilliers, built a little palisade here,
to protect the stock of goods which they exchanged
with the Indians for furs. This was on the southwestern
shore of the bay, a few miles west of the present
city of Ashland, and in the neighborhood of Whittlesey's
Creek.</p>

<p>These men did not tarry long at Chequamegon Bay.
For the most part, they merely kept their stock of
goods hid in a <i>cache</i> there, while for some ten months
they traveled through the woods, far and wide, in
search of trade with the dusky natives. But they made
the region known to Frenchmen in the settlements at
Quebec and Montreal, as a favorite meeting-place for
many tribes of Indians who came to the bay to fish.</p>

<p>The first Jesuit mission on Lake Superior was conducted
by Father Ren&eacute; M&eacute;nard, at Keweenaw Bay;
but he lost his life in the forest in 1661. In 1665
the Jesuits determined to reopen their mission on the
great lake, and for that purpose sent Father Claude<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
Allouez. Having heard of the advantages of Chequamegon
Bay, Allouez proceeded thither, and erected his
little chapel in an Indian village upon the mainland,
not far from Radisson's old palisade, and possibly at
the mouth of Vanderventer's Creek. He called his
mission La Pointe.</p>

<p>Conversions were few at La Pointe, and Allouez
soon longed for a broader field. He was relieved in
1669 by Father Jacques Marquette, a young and
earnest priest. But it was not long before the Sioux
of Minnesota quarreled with the Indians of Chequamegon
Bay; and the latter, with Marquette,
were driven eastward as far as Mackinac.</p>

<p>Although the missionaries had deserted
La Pointe, fur traders soon came
to be numerous
there. One
of the most
prominent of these was Daniel Grayson Duluth, for
whom the modern lake city of Minnesota was named.
For several years he had a small palisaded fort upon
Chequamegon Bay, and, with a lively crew of well-armed
boatmen, roamed all over the surrounding country,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
north, west, and south of Lake Superior, trading
with far-away bands of savages. He had two favorite
routes between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi
River. One was by way of the narrow and turbulent
Bois Brul&eacute;, then much choked by fallen trees and
beaver dams; a portage trail of a mile and a half from
its headwaters to those of the St. Croix River; and
thence, through foaming rapids, and deep, cool lakes,
down into the Father of Waters. The other, an easier,
but longer way, was up the rugged St. Louis River,
which separates Wisconsin from Minnesota on the
northwest, over into the Sand Lake country, and
thence, through watery labyrinths, into feeders of the
Mississippi.</p>

<p>Another adventurous French forest trader, who quartered
on Chequamegon Bay, was Le Sueur, who, in
1693, built a fort upon Madelaine Island. During
the old Fox War the valleys of the Fox and the
Wisconsin were closed to Frenchmen by the enraged
Indians. This, the most popular route between the
Great Lakes and the great river, being now unavailable,
it became necessary to keep open Duluth's old routes
from Lake Superior over to the Upper Mississippi.
This was why Le Sueur was sent to Chequamegon
Bay, to overawe the Indians of that region. He
thought that his fort would be safer from attack upon
the island, than upon the mainland. As La Pointe
had now come to be the general name of this entire
neighborhood, the island fort bore the same name as
the old headquarters on land. It is well to remember
that the history of Madelaine Island, the La Pointe of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
to-day, dates from Le Sueur; that the old La Pointe
of Radisson, Allouez, Marquette, and probably Duluth,
was on the mainland several miles to the southwest.</p>

<p>In connection with the La Pointe fort protecting the
northern approach to Duluth's trading routes, Le Sueur
erected another stockade to guard the southern end,
the location of this latter being on an island in the
Mississippi, near the present Red Wing, Minnesota.
The fort in the Mississippi soon became "the center of
commerce for the Western parts"; and the station at
La Pointe also soon rose to importance, for the Chippewas,
who had drifted far inland with the growing
scarcity of game, were led by the presence of traders
to return to Chequamegon Bay, and mass themselves
in a large village on the southwest shore.</p>

<p>Although Le Sueur was not many years in command
at the bay, we catch frequent glimpses thereafter of fur
trade stations here, French, English, and American
in turn, most of them doubtless being on Madelaine
Island. We know, for instance, that there was a
French trader at La Pointe in 1717; also, that the year
following, a French officer was sent there, with a few
soldiers, to patch up and garrison the old stockade.
Whether a garrisoned fort was kept up at the bay, from
that time till the downfall of New France (1763), we
cannot say; but it seems probable, for the geographical
position was one of great importance in the development
of the fur trade.</p>

<p>We first hear of copper in the vicinity, in 1730, when
an Indian brought a nugget to the La Pointe post; but
the whereabouts of the mine was concealed by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
savages, because of their superstitions relative to mineral
deposits.</p>

<p>The commandant of La Pointe, at this time, was La
Ronde, the chief fur trader in the Lake Superior country.
He and his son, who was his partner, built for
their trade a sailing vessel of forty tons burden, without
doubt the first one of the kind upon the great lake.
We find evidences of the La Rondes, father and son,
down as late as 1744; a curious old map of that year
gives the name of "Isle de la Ronde" to what we now
know as Madelaine.</p>

<p>We find nothing more of importance concerning Chequamegon
Bay until about 1756, when Beaubassin was
the French officer in charge of the fort. The English
colonists were harassing the French along the St. Lawrence
River; and Beaubassin, with hundreds of other
officers of wilderness forts, was ordered down with his
Indian allies to the settlements of Montreal, Three
Rivers, and Quebec, to defend New France. The
Chippewas, with other Wisconsin tribes, actuated by
extravagant promises of presents, booty, and scalps,
eagerly flocked to the banner of France, and in painted
swarms appeared in fighting array on the banks of
the St. Lawrence. But they helped the British more
than the French, for they would not fight, yet with
large appetites ate up the provisions of their allies.</p>

<p>The garrison being withdrawn from La Pointe, Madelaine
Island became a camping-ground for unlicensed
traders, who had freedom to plunder the country at
their will, for New France, tottering to her fall, could
no longer police the upper lakes. In the autumn of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
1760 one of these parties encamped upon the island.
By the time winter had set in upon them, all had left
for their wintering grounds in the forests of the far
West and Northwest, save a clerk named Joseph, who
remained in charge of the goods and what local trade
there was. With him were his wife, his small son,
and a manservant. Traditions differ as to the cause of
the servant's action; some have it, a desire for plunder;
others, his detection in a series of petty thefts,
which Joseph threatened to report. However that may
be, the servant murdered first the clerk, then the wife,
and in a few days, stung by the child's piteous cries,
killed him also. When the spring came, and the
traders returned to Chequamegon, they inquired for
Joseph and his family. The servant's reply was at first
unsatisfactory; but when pushed for an explanation,
he confessed to his terrible deed. The story goes, that
in horror the traders dismantled the old French fort,
now overgrown with underbrush, as a thing accursed,
sunk the cannon in a neighboring pool, and so destroyed
the palisade that to-day certain mysterious
grassy mounds alone remain to testify of the tragedy.
They carried their prisoner with them on their return
voyage to Montreal, but he is said to have escaped to
the Huron Indians, among whom he boasted of his
act, only to be killed by them as too cruel to be a
companion even for savages.</p>

</div>

<p>Five years later a great English trader, Alexander
Henry, who had obtained the exclusive trade on
Lake Superior, wintered on the mainland opposite
Madelaine Island. His partner was Jean Baptiste<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
Cadotte, a thrifty Frenchman, who for many years
thereafter was one of the most prominent characters on
the upper lakes. Soon after this, a Scotch trader
named John Johnston established himself on the island,
and married a comely Chippewa maiden, whose father
was chief of the native village situated four miles across
the water, on the site of the Bayfield of to-day.</p>

<p>About the beginning of the nineteenth century,
Michel, a son of old Jean Baptiste Cadotte, took up
his abode on the island; and from that time to the
present there has been a continuous settlement there,
which bears the name La Pointe. Michel, himself the
child of a Chippewa mother, but educated at Montreal,
married Equaysayway, the daughter of White Crane,
the village chief on the island, and became a person
of much importance thereabout. For over a quarter
of a century this island nabob lived at his ease; here
he cultivated a little farm, commanded a variable but
far-reaching fur trade, first as agent of the Northwest
Company, and, later, of the American Fur Company,
and reared a large family. His sons were
educated at Montreal, and become the heads of families
of traders, interpreters, and <i>voyageurs</i>.</p>

<p>To this little paradise of the Cadottes there came (in
1818) two sturdy, fairly educated young men from Massachusetts,
Lyman Marcus Warren, and his younger
brother, Truman Warren. Engaging in the fur trade,
these two brothers, of old Puritan stock, married two
half-breed daughters of Michel Cadotte. In time they
bought out Michel's interests, and managed the American
Fur Company's stations at many far-distant places,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
such as Lac Flambeau, Lac Court Oreilles, and the
St. Croix. The Warrens were the last of the great
La Pointe fur traders, Truman dying in 1825, and
Lyman twenty-two years later.</p>

<p>Lyman Warren, although possessed of a Catholic
wife, was a Presbyterian. Not since the days of Marquette
had there been an ordained minister at La Pointe,
and the Catholics were not just then ready to re&euml;nter
the long-neglected field. Warren was eager to have
religious instruction on the island, for both Indians
and whites; and in 1831 succeeded in inducing the
American Home Missionary Society to send hither,
from Mackinac, the Rev. Sherman Hall and wife, as
missionary and teacher. These were the first Protestant
missionaries upon the shores of Lake Superior.
For many years their modest little church building at
La Pointe was the center of a considerable and prosperous
mission, both island and mainland, which did
much to improve the condition of the Chippewa tribe.
In later years the mission was moved to Odanah.</p>

<p>Four years after the coming of the Halls, there
arrived at the island village a worthy Austrian priest,
Father (afterward Bishop) Baraga. In a small log
chapel by the side of the Indian graveyard, this new
mission of the older faith throve apace. Baraga visited
Europe to beg money for the cause, and in a few years
constructed a new chapel; this is sometimes shown to
summer tourists as the original chapel of Marquette,
but no part of the ancient mainland chapel went into
its construction. Baraga was a man of unusual attainments,
and spent his life in laboring for the betterment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
of the Indians of the Lake Superior country,
with a self-sacrificing zeal which is rare in the records
of any church. At present, the Franciscan friars, with
headquarters at Bayfield, on the mainland, are in charge
of the island mission.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/image154.jpg" width="600" height="411" alt="" />
</div>

<p>La Pointe has lost many of its old-time characteristics.
No longer is it the refuge of squalid Indian tribes;
no longer is it a center of the fur trade, with gayly
clothed <i>coureurs de bois</i>, with traders and their dusky
brides, with rollicking <i>voyageurs</i> taking no heed of the
morrow. With the killing of the game, and the opening
of the Lake Superior country to the occupation of
farmers and miners and manufacturers, its forest trade
has departed; the Protestant mission has followed the
majority of the Indian islanders to mainland reservations;
and the revived mission of the Mother Church
has also been quartered upon the bay shore.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span></p>

<h2 id="WISCONSIN_TERRITORY_FORMED">WISCONSIN TERRITORY FORMED</h2>

<p>What we now know as Wisconsin was part of the
vast undefined wilderness to which the Spaniards,
early in the sixteenth century, gave the name Florida.
Spain claimed the country because of the early discoveries
of her navigators and explorers. Her claim
was undisputed until there came to North America
the energetic French, who penetrated the continent
by means of the St. Lawrence and Ottawa rivers and
the Great Lakes, and gradually took possession of the
inland water systems, as fast as discovered by their
fur traders and missionaries. It should be understood,
however, that there were very few, if any, Spaniards
in all this vast territory, except on or near the Gulf
of Mexico.</p>

<p>In 1608 Quebec was founded. It is supposed that
twenty-six years later the first Frenchman reached Wisconsin,
which may, from that date (1634) till 1763, be
considered as a part of French territory. When Great
Britain conquered New France, Wisconsin became her
property, and so continued till the treaty of 1783, by
which our Northwest was declared to be American soil.</p>

<p>Owing to the vague and undefined boundaries given
by the British government to its original colonies on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
Atlantic slope, several of the thirteen States claimed
that their territory extended out into the Northwest;
but finally all these claims were surrendered to the
general government, in order that there might be
formed a national domain, from which to create new
States. By the famous Ordinance of 1787, Congress
created the Northwest Territory, which embraced the
wide stretch of country lying between the Great Lakes
and the Ohio and the Mississippi rivers. The present
Wisconsin was a part of this great territory.</p>

<p>In the year 1800 Indiana Territory was set off from
the rest of the Northwest Territory, and took Wisconsin
with it. Nine years later Illinois Territory was formed,
Wisconsin being within its bounds. Nine years after
that, when Illinois became a State, all the country lying
west of Lake Michigan was given to Michigan Territory;
thus was the ownership of Wisconsin once more
changed, and she became a part of Michigan.</p>

<p>By this time settlers were coming into the region
west of the lake. There had long been several little
French villages; but, in addition to the French, numerous
American farmers and professional men had lately
arrived. The great distance from Detroit, at a time
when there were no railways or telegraphs, was such as
to make it almost impossible to carry on any government
here. Hence, after a good deal of complaint
from the frontiersmen living to the west of Lake
Michigan, and some angry words back and forth between
these people and those residing east of the lake,
Congress was induced, in 1836, to erect Wisconsin
Territory, with its own government.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span></p>

<p>Thus far, this region beyond Lake Michigan had
borne no particular name. It was simply an outlying
part of the Northwest Territory; or of the Territories
of Indiana, Illinois, or Michigan, as the case might be.
But, now that it was to be a Territory by itself, a name
had to be adopted. The one taken was that of its
principal river, although "Chippewau" was preferred
by many people. Wisconsin is an Indian name, the
exact meaning of which is unknown; some writers have
said that it signifies "gathering of the waters," or
"meeting of the waters," but there is no warrant for
this. The earliest known French form of the word is
"Misconsing," which gradually became crystallized into
"Ouisconsin." When the English language became
dominant, it was necessary to change the spelling in
order to preserve the sound; it thus, at first, became
"Wiskonsan," or "Wiskonsin," but
finally, by official action,
"Wisconsin." The "k"
was, however, rather
strongly insisted on
by Governor Doty
and many newspaper
editors, in the
days of the Territory.</p>

<p>The first session of the legislature of the new Territory
of Wisconsin was held at the recently platted village
of Belmont, in the present county of Lafayette.
The place of meeting was a little story-and-a-half frame
house. Lead miners' shafts dimpled the country round
about, and new stumps could be seen upon every hand.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
There were many things to be done by the legislature,
such as dividing the Territory into counties, selecting
county seats, incorporating banks, and borrowing money
with which to run the new government; but the matter
which occasioned the most excitement was the location
of the capital, and the bitterness which resulted was
long felt in the political history of Wisconsin.</p>

<p>A month was spent in this contest. The claimants
were Milwaukee, Racine, Koshkonong, Fond du Lac,
Green Bay, Madison, Wisconsinapolis, Peru, Wisconsin
City, Portage, Helena, Belmont, Mineral Point, Platteville,
Cassville, Belleview, and Dubuque (now in Iowa,
but then in Wisconsin). Some of these towns existed
only upon maps published by real estate speculators.</p>

<p>Madison was a beautiful spot, in the heart of the wild
woods and lakes of central southern Wisconsin. It was
unknown save to a few trappers, and to the speculators
who had bought the land from the federal government,
and thought they saw a fortune in inducing the legislature
to adopt it as the seat of government. Madison
won, upon the argument that it was halfway between
the rival settlements on Lake Michigan and the Mississippi,
and that to build a city there would assist in the
development of the interior of the Territory.</p>

<p>When Madison was chosen, a surveyor hurried thither,
and in a blinding snowstorm laid out the prospective
city. The village grew slowly, and it was November,
1838, before the legislature could meet in its new home.</p>

<h2 id="WISCONSIN_BECOMES_A_STATE">WISCONSIN BECOMES A STATE</h2>

<p>Some of the people of Wisconsin were not long content
with a Territorial government. The Territory
was only two years old when a bill was introduced in
Congress for a State government, but the attempt failed.
In 1841 Governor Doty, the leader in the movement,
had the question put to popular vote; but it was lost,
as it also was in the year following. In 1843 a third
attempt was defeated in the Territorial council (or senate);
and in 1845, still another met defeat in the Territorial
house of representatives (or assembly).</p>

<p>But at last our Territorial representative in Congress
gave notice (January 9, 1846), "of a motion for leave
to introduce a bill to enable the people of Wisconsin
to form a constitution and State government, and for
the admission of such State into the Union." He followed
this, a few days later, by the introduction of a
bill to that effect; the bill passed, and in August the
measure was approved by President Polk.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the council and house of Wisconsin Territory
had favorably voted on the proposition. This was
in January and February, 1846. In April the question
of Statehood was passed upon by the people of the
Territory, the returns this time showing 12,334 votes
for, and 2487 against. In August, Governor Dodge
issued a proclamation calling a convention for the drafting
of a constitution.</p>

<p>The convention was in session in the Territorial capitol
at Madison, between October 5 and December 16,
1846. But the constitution which it framed was rejected
by the people. The contest over the document had been
of an exciting nature; the defeat was owing to differences
of opinion upon the articles relating to the rights
of married women, exemptions, banks, the elective judiciary,
and the number of members of the legislature.</p>

<p>As soon as practicable, Governor Dodge called a special
session of the Territorial legislature, which made
provisions for a second constitutional convention. Most
of the members of the first convention declined re&euml;lection;
six only were returned. The second convention
was in session at Madison from December 15, 1847,
to February 1, 1848. The members of both conventions
were men of high standing in their several communities,
and later many of them held prominent positions
in the service of the State and the nation.</p>

<p>The constitution adopted by the second convention
was so satisfactory to most people, that the popular verdict
in March (16,799 ayes and 6384 noes) surprised no
one. Arrangements for a new bill in Congress, admitting
Wisconsin to the Union, were already well under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
way. Upon the very day of the vote by the people,
before the result was known, the Territorial legislature
held its final meeting, and left everything ready for the
new State government.</p>

<p>The general election for the first State officers and the
members of the first State legislature was held May 8.
President Polk approved the congressional act of admission
May 29. Upon the 7th of June, Governor Nelson
Dewey and his fellow-officials were sworn into office,
and the legislature opened its first session.</p>

<p>In the old lead mining days of Wisconsin, miners
from southern Illinois and still farther south returned
home every winter, and came back to the "diggings"
in the spring, thus imitating the migrations of the
fish popularly called the "sucker," in the south-flowing
rivers of the region. For this reason the south-winterers
were humorously called "Suckers." On the other hand,
lead miners from the far-off Eastern States were unable
to return home every winter, and at first lived in
rude dugouts, burrowing into the hillsides after the
fashion of the badger. These burrowing men were the
first permanent settlers in the mines north of the Illinois
line, and called themselves "Badgers." Thus
Wisconsin, in later days, when it was thought necessary
to adopt a nickname, was, by its own people, dubbed
"The Badger State."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<h2 id="THE_BOUNDARIES_OF_WISCONSIN">THE BOUNDARIES OF WISCONSIN</h2>

<p>In the Ordinance of 1787, whereby Congress created
the old Northwest Territory out of the triangle of
country lying between the Ohio and Mississippi rivers
and Lake of the Woods and the Great Lakes, it was
provided that this vast region should eventually be
parcelled into five States. The east-and-west dividing
line was to be "drawn through the southerly bend or
extreme of Lake Michigan"; south of this line were to
be erected three States, and north of it two. "Whenever,"
the ordinance read, "any of the said States shall
have sixty thousand free inhabitants therein, such State
shall be admitted" to the Union.</p>

<p>It should be said, in explanation of this east-and-west
line, that all the maps of Lake Michigan then extant
represented the head of the lake as being much farther
north than it was proved to be by later surveys. The
line as fixed in the ordinance proved to be a bone of
contention in the subsequent carving of the Northwest
Territory into States, leading to a good deal of angry
discussion before the boundaries of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,
Michigan, and Wisconsin, the five States eventually
formed from the Territory, became established as they
are to-day.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/image163.jpg" width="600" height="480"  alt="" />
</div>

<p>Ohio, the first State to be set off, insisted that Maumee
Bay, with the town of Toledo, should be included
in her bounds, although it lay north of the east-and-west
line of the ordinance. Michigan, on the other
hand, stoutly insisted on the line as laid down in the
law. In 1835 and 1836 there were some popular disturbances
along the border; one of these, though bloodless,
was so violent as to receive the name of "the
Toledo war." Congress finally settled the quarrel by
giving Ohio the northern boundary which she desired,
regardless of the terms of the ordinance; Michigan
was compensated by the gift of what we now call the
"northern peninsula" of that State, although it had
all along been understood that the country lying west<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
of Lake Michigan should be the property of the fifth
State, whenever that was created. Thus, in order that
Ohio might have another lake port from Michigan, Wisconsin
lost this immense tract of mining country to the
north.</p>

<p>When Indiana came to be erected, it was seen that to
adopt the east-and-west line, established by the ordinance,
would be to deprive her entirely of any part of
the coast of Lake Michigan. In order, therefore, to
satisfy her, Congress took another strip, ten miles wide,
from the southern border of Michigan, and gave it to
the new State. Michigan made no objection to this
fresh violation of the agreement of 1787, because there
were no important harbors or towns involved.</p>

<p>Illinois next knocked at the door of the Union. The
same conditions applied to her as to Indiana; a strict
construction of the ordinance would deprive her of an
opening on the lake. The Illinois delegate who argued
this matter in Congress was shrewd; he contended that
his State must become intimately connected with the
growing commerce of the northern lakes, else she would
be led, from her commercial relations upon the south-flowing
Mississippi and Ohio rivers, to join a Southern
confederacy in case the Union should be broken up.
This was in 1818, and shows how early in our history
there had come to be, in the minds of some far-seeing
men, a fear that the growing power of slavery might
some time lead to secession. The argument prevailed
in Congress, and there was voted to Illinois a strip of
territory sixty-one miles wide, lying north of the east-and-west
line.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span></p>

<p>Thus again was the region later to be called Wisconsin
deprived of a large and valuable tract. When Wisconsin
Territory was created, there was a great deal of
indignation expressed by some of her people, at being
deprived of this wide belt of country embracing 8500
square miles of exceedingly fertile soil, numerous river
and lake ports, many miles of fine water power, and the
sites of Chicago, Rockford, Freeport, Galena, Oregon,
Dixon, and numerous other prosperous cities.</p>

<p>An attempt was made in 1836, at the time the Territory
was established, to secure for Wisconsin's benefit
the old east-and-west line, as its rightful southern
boundary. But Congress declined to grant this request.
Three years later, the Wisconsin Territorial legislature
declared that "a large and valuable tract of country is
now held by the State of Illinois, contrary to the manifest
right and consent of the people of this Territory."</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the district in northern Illinois
which was claimed by Wisconsin, were invited by these
resolutions to express their opinion on the matter. Public
meetings were consequently held in several of the
Illinois towns interested; and resolutions were adopted,
declaring in favor of the Wisconsin claim. The movement
culminated in a convention at Rockford (July 6,
1839), attended by delegates from nine of the fourteen
Illinois counties involved. This convention recommended
the counties to elect delegates to a convention
to be held in Madison, "for the purpose of adopting
such lawful and constitutional measures as may seem
to be necessary and proper for the early adjustment of
the southern boundary."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span></p>

<p>Curiously enough, the weight of public sentiment in
Wisconsin itself did not favor the movement. At a
large meeting held in Green Bay, the following April,
the people of that section passed resolutions "viewing
the resolutions of the legislature with concern and regret,"
and asking that they be rescinded. With this,
popular agitation ceased for the time; and in the following
year the legislature promptly defeated a proposition
for the renewal of the question.</p>

<p>Governor Doty, however, was a stanch advocate of
the idea, and at the legislative session of 1842 contrived
to work up considerable enthusiasm in its behalf. A
bill was reported by the committee on Territorial affairs,
asking the people in the disputed tract to hold an election
on the question of uniting with Wisconsin. There
were some rather fiery speeches upon the subject, some
of the orators going so far as to threaten force in acquiring
the wished-for strip; but the legislature itself took
no action. However, in Stephenson and Boone counties,
Illinois, elections were actually held, at which all
but one or two votes were cast in favor of the Wisconsin
claim.</p>

<p>Governor Doty, thus encouraged, busily continued
his agitation. He issued proclamations warning Illinois
that it was "exercising an accidental and temporary
jurisdiction" over the disputed strip, and calling
on the two legislatures to authorize the people to vote
on the question of restoring Wisconsin to her "ancient
limits." At first, neither the legislatures of Illinois nor
Wisconsin paid much attention to the matter. Finally,
in 1843, the Wisconsin legislature sent a rather warlike<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
address to Congress, in which secession was clearly
threatened, unless the "birthright of Wisconsin" were
restored. Congress, however, very sensibly paid no
heed to the address, and gradually the excitement subsided,
until eventually Wisconsin was made a State,
with her present boundaries.</p>

<p>We have seen that the northern peninsula was given
to Michigan as a recompense for her loss of Toledo and
Maumee Bay. But when it became necessary to determine
the boundary between the peninsula and the new
Territory of Wisconsin, now set off from Michigan, some
difficulty arose, owing to the fact that the country had
not been thoroughly surveyed, and there was no good
map of it extant.</p>

<p>There were various propositions; one of them was, to
use the Chocolate River as part of the line; had this
prevailed, Wisconsin would have gained the greater
part of the peninsula. But the line of division at last
adopted was that of the Montreal and Menominee
rivers, by the way of Lake Vieux D&eacute;sert. This line
had been selected in 1834, because a map published
that year represented the headwaters of those rivers as
meeting in Lake Vieux D&eacute;sert; hence it was supposed
by the congressional committee that this would make
an excellent natural boundary. When, however, the
line came to be actually laid out by the surveyors, six
years later, for the purpose of setting boundary monuments,
it was discovered that Lake Vieux D&eacute;sert had
no connection with either stream, being, in fact, the
headwaters of the Wisconsin River; and that the running
of the line through the woods, between the far-distant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
headwaters of the Montreal and Menominee,
so as to touch the lake on the way, involved a laborious
task, and resulted in a crooked boundary. But it was
by this time too late to correct the geographical error,
and the awkward boundary thus remains.</p>

<p>As originally provided by the Ordinance of 1787,
Wisconsin, as the fifth State to be created out of the
Northwest Territory, was, even after being shorn upon
the south and northeast, at least entitled to have as
her western boundary the Mississippi to its source, and
thence a straight line running northward to the Lake
of the Woods and the Canadian boundary. But here
again she was to suffer loss of soil, this time in favor of
Minnesota.</p>

<p>As a Territory, Wisconsin had been given sway over
all the country lying to the west, as far as the Missouri
River. In 1838, all beyond the Mississippi was
detached, and erected into the Territory of Iowa. Eight
years later, when Wisconsin first sought to be a State,
the question arose as to her western boundary. Naturally,
the people of the eastern and southern sections
wished the one set forth in the ordinance. But settlements
had by this time been established along the
Upper Mississippi and in the St. Croix valley. These
were far removed from the bulk of settlement elsewhere
in Wisconsin, and had neither social nor business interests
in common with them. The people of the northwest
wished to be released from Wisconsin, in order
that they might either cast their fortunes with their
near neighbors in the new Territory of Minnesota, or
join a movement just then projected for the creation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
of an entirely new State, to be called "Superior." This
proposed state was to embrace all the country north of
Mont Trempealeau and east of the Mississippi, including
the entire northern peninsula, if the latter could be
obtained; thus commanding the southern and western
shores of Lake Superior, with the mouth of Green Bay
and the foot of Lake Michigan to the southeast.</p>

<p>The St. Croix representative in the legislature was
especially wedded to the Superior project. He pleaded
earnestly and eloquently for his people, whose progress,
he said, would be "greatly hampered by being connected
politically with a country from which they are
separated by nature, cut off from communication by
immense spaces of wilderness between." A memorial
from the settlers themselves stated the case with even
more vigor, asserting that they were "widely separated
from the settled parts of Wisconsin, not only by hundreds
of miles of mostly waste and barren lands, which
must remain uncultivated for ages, but equally so by a
diversity of interests and character in the population."
All of this reads curiously enough in these days, when
the intervening wilderness resounds with the hum of
industry and "blossoms as the rose." But that was
long before the days of railroads; the dense forests of
central and western Wisconsin then constituted a formidable
wilderness, peopled only by savages and wild
beasts.</p>

<p>Unable to influence the Wisconsin legislature, which
stubbornly contended for the possession of the original
tract, the St. Croix people next urged their claims upon
Congress. The proposed State of Superior found little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
favor at Washington, but there was a general feeling
that Wisconsin would be much too large unless trimmed.
The result was that when she was finally admitted as
a State, the St. Croix River was, in large part, made
her northwest boundary; Minnesota in this manner acquired
a vast stretch of country, including the thriving
city of St. Paul.</p>

<p>Wisconsin was thus shorn of valuable territory on the
south, to please Illinois; on the northeast, to favor
Michigan; and on the northwest, that some of her settlers
might join their fortunes with Minnesota. The
State, however, is still quite as large as most of her
sisters in the Old Northwest, and possesses an unusual
variety of soils, and a great wealth of forests, mines, and
fisheries. There is a strong probability that, had Congress,
in 1848, given to Wisconsin her "ancient limits,"
as defined by the Ordinance of 1787, the movement to
create the proposed state of "Superior" would have
gathered strength in the passing years, and possibly
would have achieved success, thus depriving us of our
great northern forests and mines, and our outlet upon
the northern lake.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span></p>

<h2 id="LIFE_IN_PIONEER_DAYS">LIFE IN PIONEER DAYS</h2>

<p>So long as the fur trade remained the principal business
in Wisconsin, the French were still supreme
at Green Bay and Prairie du Chien; and, until a third
of the nineteenth century had passed away, there existed
at these outposts of New France a social life
which smacked of the "old r&eacute;gime," bearing more
traces of seventeenth-century Normandy than of Puritan
New England. With the decline of the fur trade, a
new order of things slowly grew up.</p>

<p>There being little legal machinery west of Lake
Michigan, before Wisconsin Territory was erected,
local government was slow to establish itself. Nothing
but the good temper and stout common sense of the
people prevented anarchy, under such a condition of
affairs. For many years, the few public enterprises
were undertaken at private expense. At Green Bay,
schools were thus conducted, as early as 1817. In 1821
the citizens of that village raised a fund by popular
subscription, and built a jail; and eleven years later,
they asked the legislature of Michigan Territory to
pay for it. There were some Territorial taxes levied in
1817, but the gathering of them was not very successful.
The first county to levy a tax was Crawford, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
which Prairie du Chien was the seat, but considerable
difficulty appears to have been experienced in collecting
the money.</p>

<p>Finally, Wisconsin Territory was organized, and the
legislature assembled (1838) in Madison, the new capital.
The accommodations at that raw little woodland
village were meager, even for pioneer times. The Territorial
building of stone, and a few rude frame and log
houses in the immediate neighborhood, were all there
was of the infant city. Only fifty strangers could be
decently lodged there, and a proposition to adjourn to
Milwaukee was favored. But as the lakeshore metropolis,
also a small village, could offer no better accommodations,
it was decided to stay at the capital, and brave
it out on the straw and hay mattresses, of which, however,
there were not enough to supply the demand.</p>

<p>This was long before railroads had reached Wisconsin.
Travel through the new Territory was by boat,
horseback, or a kind of snow sledge called a "French
train." There were no roads, except such as had been
developed from the old deep-worn Indian trails which
interlaced the face of the country, and traces of which
can still be seen in many portions of the State. The
pioneers found that these trails, with a little straightening,
often followed the best possible routes for bridle
paths or wagon roads. It was not long before they
were being used by long lines of teams, transporting
smelted lead from the mines of southwest Wisconsin to
the Milwaukee and Galena docks; on the return,
they carried supplies for the "diggings," and sawmill
machinery into the interior forests. Farmers' wagons<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
and stagecoaches followed in due time. Bridges were
but slowly built; the unloaded wagons were ferried
across rivers in Indian "dugout" canoes, the horses
swimming behind, and the freight being brought over
in relays.</p>

<p>In 1837 there was a financial crisis throughout the
country, and this checked Western immigration for a
few years. But there was not enough money in Wisconsin
for bank failures materially to affect the people;
so, when the tide of settlement again flowed hither, the
Badgers were as strong and hopeful as ever.</p>

<p>People coming to Wisconsin from the East often
traveled all the way in their own wagons; or would
take a lake boat at Buffalo, and then proceed by water
to Detroit, Green Bay, or Chicago, thence journeying
in caravans to the interior.</p>

<p>Frontier life, in those days, was of the simplest character.
The immigrants were for the most part used to
hard work and plain fare. Accordingly the privations
of their new surroundings involved relatively little hardship,
although sometimes a pioneer farmer was fifty
or a hundred miles from a gristmill, a store, or a post
office, and generally his highway thither was but a
blazed bridle path through the tangled forest.</p>

<p>Often his only entertainments throughout the year
were "bees" for raising log houses or barns for newcomers,
and on these occasions all the settlers for scores
of miles around would gather in a spirit of helpful comradery.
Occasionally the mail carrier, either afoot or
on horseback, would wish accommodation over night.
Particularly fortunate was the man who maintained a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
river ferry at the crossing of some much-frequented
trail; he could have frequent chats with strangers, and
collect stray shillings from mail carriers or other travelers
whose business led them through the wilderness.</p>

<p>Often the new settler brought considerable flour and
salt pork with him, in his journey to the West; but it
was not at first easy to get a fresh supply. Curiously
enough, although in the midst of a wild abundance,
civilized man at the outset sometimes suffered for the
bare necessaries of life. As soon, however, as he could
garner his first crop, and become accustomed to the
new conditions, he was usually proof against disaster
of this kind; fish and game were so abundant, in
their season, that in due time the backwoodsman
was able to win a wholesome livelihood from the
storehouse of nature.</p>

<p>Satisfactory education for youth was a plant of
comparatively small growth. At first there
was not enough money in the country to
pay competent teachers. The half-educated
sons and daughters of the pioneers
taught the earliest schools,
often upon a private subscription
basis; text-books
were few, appliances
generally wanting,
and the results
were, for many
years, far from
satisfactory. As
for spiritual instruction,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
this was given by itinerant missionary preachers
and priests, of various denominations, who braved
great hardships while making their rounds on horseback
or afoot, and deserve to rank among the most
daring of the pioneer class. In due time churches and
schools were firmly established throughout the Territory.</p>

<p>In addition to these farmer colonists, there came
many young professional and business men, chiefly
from New York and New England, seeking an opening
in the new Territory for the acquisition of fame
and wealth. Many of these were men of marked
ability, with high ambition and progressive ideas, who
soon took prominent part in molding public opinion
in the young Wisconsin. There are, all things considered,
no abler, more forceful men in the Wisconsin
of to-day than were some of those, now practically all
passed away, who shaped her destinies in the fourth
and fifth decades of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The sessions of the legislature were the principal
events of the year. Prominent men from all over
Wisconsin were each winter attracted to Madison, as
legislators, lobbyists, or visitors, crowding the primitive
little hotels and indulging in rather boisterous gayety;
for humor in those pioneer days was often uncouth.
There was overmuch "horseplay," hard drinking, and
profanity; and now and then, as the result of a warm
discussion, a tussle with fists and canes.</p>

<p>The newspapers were given to rude personal attacks
upon their enemies; one would suppose, to read the
columns of the old journals, that editors thought it
their chief business in life to carry on a wordy, bitter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
quarrel with some rival editor or politician. But this
was largely on the surface, for effect. As a matter of
fact, strong attachments between men were more frequent
then than now. There was a deal of dancing
and miscellaneous merrymaking at these legislative
sessions; and travelers have left us, in their letters
and journals, statements which show that they greatly
relished the experience of tarrying there on their
winter journeys across the Territory, and of being
entertained by the good-hearted villagers.</p>

<p>Pioneers, in their stories of those early years, are
fond of calling them the "good old times," and styling
present folk and manners degenerate. No doubt there
was a certain charm in the rude simplicity of frontier
life, but there were, as well, great inconveniences and
rude discomforts, with which few pioneers of our day
would wish to be confronted, after having tasted the
pleasures arising from the wealth of conveniences of
every sort which distinguishes these latter days. As
far back in time as human records go, we ever find
old men bewailing prevalent degeneracy, and sighing in
vain for "the good old times" when they were young.
It is a blessing given to the old that the disagreeable
incidents of their youth should be forgotten, and
only the pleasant events remembered. As a matter of
fact, we of to-day may well rejoice that, while Wisconsin
enjoyed a lusty youth, she has now, in the fullness
of time, grown into a great and ambitious commonwealth,
lacking nothing that her sisters own, in all that
makes for the prosperity and happiness of her people.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span></p>

<h2 id="THE_DEVELOPMENT_OF_ROADS">THE DEVELOPMENT OF ROADS</h2>

<p>When white men first came to our land, the
Indian trails formed a network of narrow, deep-sunken
paths over the face of the country, as they connected
village with village, and these with the hunting
and fishing resorts of the aborigines. Many of the
most important trails simply followed the still earlier
tracks of the buffalo, which in great herds wandered
from plain to plain, in search of forage, or in hiding
from man, through the dark forest and over the hills.
The buffalo possessed an unerring instinct for selecting
the best places for a road, high ridges overlooking the
lowlands, and the easy slopes of hills. In the Far
West, they first found the passes over the Rockies, just
as, still earlier, they crossed the Alleghanies by the
most favorable routes.</p>

<p>The Indian followed in the footsteps of the buffalo,
both to pursue him as game, and better to penetrate
the wilderness. The white man followed the well-defined
Indian trail, first on foot, then on horseback;
next (after straightening and widening the curving
path), by freight wagon and by stagecoach; and then,
many years later, the railway engineer often found his
best route by the side of the developed buffalo track,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
especially in crossing the mountain ranges. The Union
Pacific and the Southern Pacific railways are notable
examples of lines which have simply followed well-worn
overland roads, which were themselves but the
transcontinental buffalo paths of old.</p>

<p>An interesting story might be written concerning the
development of the principal Indian trails in Wisconsin
into the wagon roads of the pioneers, and some of these
into the military roads made by the federal government
for the marching of troops between the frontier forts.
Without fairly good roads, at least during the winter
and summer months, it would have been impossible for
Wisconsin to grow into a great State; for good roads
are necessary to enable settlers, tools, and supplies to
get into the country, and to afford an outlet for crops.
For this reason, in any newly settled region, one of the
first duties of the people is to make roads and bridges.</p>

<p>We have still much to do in Wisconsin, before we
can have such highways as they possess in the old
eastern States. In many parts of our State, the country
roads in the rainy seasons are of little credit to us.
But the worst of them are much better than were some
of the best in pioneer days, and some of our principal
thoroughfares between the larger cities are fairly good.</p>

<p>The federal government set a good example by having
its soldiers build several military roads, especially
between Forts Howard (Green Bay), Winnebago (Portage),
and Crawford (Prairie du Chien). In Territorial
and early Statehood days, charters were granted by the
legislature for the building and maintenance of certain
tollroads between large towns; some of these were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
paved with gravel or broken stone, others with planks.
Many of the plank roads remained in use until about
1875; but before that date all highways became the
property of the public, and tollgates were removed.
Bridges charging tolls are still in use in some parts of
the State, where the people have declined to tax themselves
for a public bridge, which therefore has been
built by a private company in consideration of the privilege
of collecting tolls from travelers.</p>

<p>Early in the year when Wisconsin Territory was
erected (1836), and while it was still attached to Michigan
Territory, there was a strong movement, west of
Lake Michigan, in favor of a railway between Milwaukee
and Prairie du Chien, connecting the lake with
the Mississippi River. Congress was petitioned by the
legislative council of Michigan to make an appropriation
to survey the proposed line. There were as yet
very few agricultural settlers along the route; the chief
business of the road was to be the shipment of lead
from the mines of the southwest to the Milwaukee
docks; thence it was to be carried by vessels to Buffalo,
and sent forward in boats, over the Erie Canal, to the
Hudson River and New York.</p>

<p>This was in January; in the September following,
after Wisconsin Territory had been formed, a public
meeting was held in Milwaukee, to petition the Territorial
legislature to pass an act incorporating a company to
construct the proposed lead-mine road, upon a survey
to be made at the expense of the United States, and
there was even some talk of another road to the far-away
wilderness of Lake Superior.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span></p>

<p>But this early railway project was premature. Wisconsin
had then but twenty-two thousand inhabitants,
and Milwaukee was a small frontier village. Then
again, railroading in the United States was still in its
infancy. In Pennsylvania there was a small line,
hardly better than an old-fashioned horse car track,
over which a wheezy little locomotive slowly made
occasional trips, and the Baltimore and Ohio railway
had not long before experimented with sails as a motive
power. It is not surprising, therefore, that Congress
acted slowly in regard to the overambitious Wisconsin
project, and that it was nearly fourteen and a half years
before a railway was actually opened in this State.</p>

<p>Indeed, many people thought at that time that
canals, costing less in construction and in operation,
were more serviceable for Wisconsin than railways.
The people of northern Wisconsin were particularly
eager for canals; in the southern part, railways were
most popular. The most important canal project was
that known as the Fox and Wisconsin rivers improvement.
From the earliest historic times, these two
opposite-flowing rivers, whose waters approach within
a mile and a half of each other at Portage, had been
used as a boat route between the Great Lakes and the
Mississippi River. We have seen, in preceding chapters,
what an important part was played by this
route in the early history of Wisconsin. But when
large vessels became necessary to the trade of the
region, and steam navigation was introduced, it was
found that the historic water way presented many practical
difficulties: the Fox abounds in rapids below<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
Lake Winnebago, and in its upper waters is very
shallow; the Wisconsin is troubled with shifting sand
bars. In order to accommodate the traffic, a canal
was necessary along the portage path, and extensive
improvements in both rivers were essential.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/image181.jpg" width="600" height="514" alt="" />
</div>

<p>As early as 1839, Congress was asked to aid in
this work, and from time to time such aid has been
given. But, although several millions of dollars have,
through all these years, been spent upon the two
streams, there has been no important modern navigation
through them between the Great Lakes and the
great river. The chief result has been the admirable
system of locks between Lake Winnebago and Green<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
Bay, making available the splendid water power of the
lower valley of the Fox.</p>

<p>Another water way project was that of the Milwaukee
and Rock River Canal. This was designed to
connect the waters of the Milwaukee and Rock rivers,
thereby providing an additional way for vessels to pass
from Lake Michigan to the Mississippi. A company
was incorporated, with a capital of a million dollars, and
Congress made a large grant of land to Wisconsin Territory.
But after some years of uncertainty and heavy
expense the project was abandoned as impracticable.</p>

<p>The Territorial legislature began to charter railway
companies as early as 1836, but the Milwaukee and
Mississippi was the first road actually built. The track
was laid in 1851 and a train was run out to Waukesha,
a distance of twenty miles. In 1856 the line reached
the Mississippi. This was the modest beginning of
the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul system.</p>

<p>The Chicago and Northwestern Railway entered Wisconsin
from Chicago about the same time (1855).
Numerous small lines were built before the War of
Secession, nearly all of them being soon swallowed
up by the larger companies. During the war, there
was stagnation in railway building, but when peace was
declared there was renewed activity, and to-day Wisconsin
is as well provided with good railways as any
State of its size and population in the Union.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span></p>

<h2 id="THE_PHALANX_AT_CERESCO">THE PHALANX AT CERESCO</h2>

<p>In the fourth decade of the nineteenth century there
was much agitation, both in France and America,
over the teachings of a remarkable man named Fran&ccedil;ois
Marie Charles Fourier. He claimed that if people
would band themselves together in communities, in the
proper spirit of mutual forbearance and helpfulness,
and upon plans laid down by him, it would be proved
that they could get along very well with no strife of any
sort, either in business, or religion, or politics. Then,
if the nations would but unite themselves in the same
way, universal peace would reign.</p>

<p>During the stirring times of the French Revolution
and of the great Napoleon, there had been much social
agitation of the violent sort. A reaction had come.
The talk about the rights of man was no longer confined
to the violent, revengeful element of the population;
it was now chiefly heard among the good and
gentle folk, among men of wealth and benevolence,
as well as those of learning and poverty.</p>

<p>In France, Fourier was the leader among this new
class of socialists. In France, England, and Holland,
colonies more or less after the Fourier model were
established; and it was not long before communities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
came to be founded in the United States. The most
famous of these latter was Brook Farm, in Massachusetts,
because among its members were several well-known
authors and scientists, who wrote a great deal
about their experiences there. But the only community
in America conducted strictly on Fourier's plan,
flourished in Wisconsin.</p>

<p>The <i>New York Tribune</i>, edited by Horace Greeley,
a noted reformer, was earnest in advocating Fourierism,
as it was called, doing much to attract attention to
"the principle of equitable distributions." One of the
many readers of the <i>Tribune</i> was Warren Chase, of
Kenosha, a young New Hampshire man, thirty years
of age, who became much attached to the new idea.</p>

<p>This was during the winter of 1843-44. Chase
gathered about him at Kenosha a group of intelligent
men and women, some of whom had property, and they
formed a stock company, incorporated under the laws
of Wisconsin Territory, but based strictly on the plans
laid down by Fourier.</p>

<p>Having purchased six hundred acres of government
land, in a gentle valley within the present Ripon township,
in Fond du Lac county, nineteen pioneers, led by
Chase, made their way thither in May. There were
no railroads in those days, and the little company proceeded
overland through flower-decked prairies, and
over wooded hills, in oxcarts and horse wagons, with
droves of cattle, and tools and utensils.</p>

<p>The reformers called their colony "Ceresco," after
Ceres, the goddess of agriculture. Plowing was commenced,
buildings were erected, shops and forges established.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
Very soon some two hundred men, women, and
children had arrived, and in due time many branches
of industry were in full operation.</p>

<p>The Ceresco community was, as suggested by Fourier,
styled a "phalanx." The members were classified,
according to their capacity to labor, in educational,
mechanical, and agricultural series, each series being
divided into groups. The government was headed by
a president and nine councilors; each series had a
chairman, and each group a foreman.</p>

<p>Labor was voluntary, the shops being owned by the
community at large; while the land was divided equally
among all the members, old and young, save that no
family might possess over forty acres. As the community
grew, more land was purchased for their use.
The council laid out the work to be done, or the policy
to be pursued. When there was a question to be
decided, the series interested voted upon it; but in
some important cases, the matter was referred for final
action to the several groups. Each person received
pay according to his value as a worker, the record
being kept by the foreman of his group. They were
not paid upon the same scale; for instance, the members
of the council and the school-teachers received
more than skilled mechanical laborers, and these in
turn more than ordinary workmen.</p>

<p>The phalanx at first lived in temporary quarters, and
a year later erected a large building "four hundred feet
in length, consisting of two rows of tenements, with
a hall between, under one roof." Each family lived
in its own compartments, but all ate in common at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
a boarding house called the "phalanstery," where a
charge was made of seventy-five cents a week for
each person. The "unitary" was a large building
used for business and social meetings, these being
held in the evenings; each Tuesday evening the literary
and debating club met, Wednesday evening the
singing school, and Thursday evening a dancing party.</p>

<p>Unlike many other communities, the Fourier colonies
were not religious in character. Each member of the
phalanx at Ceresco might worship as he pleased. At
various times, for the membership fluctuated somewhat,
ministers of different denominations were members of
the colony, and frequently there were visits from wandering
missionaries.</p>

<p>None of the colonists were allowed to use intoxicating
liquors as a beverage. There must be no vulgar
language, swearing, or gambling; and one of the
by-laws commanded that "censoriousness and fault-finding,
indolence, abuse of cattle or horses, hunting or
fishing on the first day of the week, shall be deemed
misdemeanors, and shall be punishable by reprimand or
expulsion." These punishments were the only ones
which the community could inflict upon its members,
for it had no judicial powers under the law.</p>

<p>But there was small need of punishments at Ceresco.
Its members were, as a rule, men and women of most
excellent character. There was never any dishonesty,
or other serious immorality, within the phalanx; the
few neighboring settlers regarded the reformers with
genuine respect. All the proceedings of the community
were open, and its carefully kept accounts and records<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
might be inspected by any one at any time. Whenever
charges were brought against a member, they
were laid before the full assembly at the next weekly
meeting; a week elapsed before consideration, in order
to give ample opportunity for defense; then the entire
body of colonists, women as well as men, voted on
the question, acquitting the offender or reprimanding
him or, by a two-thirds vote, expelling him from the
phalanx.</p>

<p>Wisconsin was then sparsely settled at best; the
peaceful little valley of Ceresco was equally far removed
from the centers of population at Green Bay
and in the southern portion of the Territory. Yet many
pioneers came toiling over the country, to apply for admission
to this Garden of Eden. But it is recorded
that not one in four was taken into fellowship, for the
phalanx desired "no lazy, shiftless, ne'er-do-well members,"
and only those believed to be wise, industrious,
and benevolent were taken into the fold.</p>

<p>And thus the Ceresco phalanx seemed mightily to
prosper. Its stock earned good dividends, its property
was in excellent condition, the quality of its membership
could not be bettered. Far and near were its
praises sung. The <i>New York Tribune</i> gave weekly
news of its doings, and was ever pointing to it as
worthy of emulation; the Brook Farm paper hailed it
as proof that socialism had at last succeeded.</p>

<p>Had each member been equally capable with his fellows,
had the families been of the same size, had there
been no jealousies, no bickerings, had these good folk
been without ambition, had they, in short, been contented,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
the phalanx might have remained a success.
They were clothed, fed, and housed at less expense
than were outsiders; they had many social enjoyments
not known elsewhere in the valley; and, according to
all the philosophers, should have been a happy people.</p>

<p>The public table, the public amusement rooms, and
all that, had at first a spice of pleasant novelty; but
soon there was a realization that this had not the
charm of home life, that one's family affairs were too
much the affairs of all. The strong and the willing
saw that they were yoked to those who were weak and
slothful; there was no chance for natural abilities to
assert themselves, no reward for individual excellence.</p>

<p>Wisconsin became a State in 1848. Everywhere,
ambitious and energetic citizens in the rapidly growing
commonwealth were making a great deal of money
through land speculations and the planting of new industries,
everywhere but in Ceresco, where the community
life allowed no man to rise above the common
level. The California gold fields, opened the following
year, also sorely tempted the young men. The members
of the phalanx found themselves hampered by
their bond. Caring no longer for the reformation of
society, they eagerly clamored to get back into the
whirl of that struggle for existence which, only a few
years before, they had voted so unnecessary to human
welfare.</p>

<p>In 1850 the good folk at Ceresco voted unanimously,
and in the best of feeling toward one another, to disband
their colony. They sold their lands at a fair
profit to each; and very soon, in the rush for wealth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
and for a chance to exercise their individual powers,
were widely distributed over the face of the country.
Some of them ultimately won much worldly success;
others fell far below the level of prosperity maintained
in the phalanx, and came to bemoan the "good old
days" of the social community, when the strong were
obliged to bolster the weak.</p>

<h2 id="A_MORMON_KING">A MORMON KING</h2>

<p>In the year 1843 there came from New York to the
village of Burlington, Racine county, an eccentric
young lawyer named James Jesse Strang. Originally
a farmer's boy, he had been a country school-teacher,
a newspaper editor, and a temperance lecturer, as well
as a lawyer. Possessed of an uneasy, ambitious spirit,
he had wandered much, and changed his occupation
with apparent ease. Strang was passionately fond of
reading, was gifted with a remarkable memory, and developed
a fervent, persuasive style of oratory, which he
delighted in employing. He often astonished the courts
by the shrewd eloquence with which he supported
strange, unexpected points in law. It is related of him
that, soon after he came to Wisconsin, he brought a
suit to recover the value of honey which, he claimed,
had been stolen from his client's hives by the piratical
bees of a neighbor, and his arguments were so plausible
that he nearly won his case.</p>

<p>In less than a year after his arrival in Burlington,
the village was visited by some Mormon missionaries.
They came from Nauvoo, Illinois, on the banks of the
Mississippi River, where there was a settlement of so-called
Latter-Day Saints, who lived under the sway of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
a designing knave named Joseph Smith. Strang at
once became a convert, and entered into the movement
with such earnestness that, with his oratory, his ability
to manage men, and his keen zest for notoriety, he
became one of the most prominent followers of the
faith.</p>

<p>Six months after Strang's conversion, Joseph Smith,
the president and prophet of the Mormons, was killed
by an Illinois mob. At once there arose a desperate
strife among the leaders, for the successorship to Joseph.
Two of the number, Brigham Young and Strang,
were men of ability, and the contest soon narrowed
down to them. Young had the powerful support of
the council of the church, known as "the twelve apostles";
but Strang produced a letter said to have been
written by Joseph just before his death, in which
Strang was named as his successor, with directions to
lead the Mormons to a new "city of promise" in Wisconsin,
to be called "Voree."</p>

<p>The "apostles" at Nauvoo denounced Strang as
an impostor, declared that his letter was a forgery,
and attacked him bitterly in their official newspapers,
published at Nauvoo and at Liverpool, England. But
Strang was not easily put down. A great many of
the fanatics at Nauvoo believed in this impetuous
young leader, who defended his cause with tact and
forceful eloquence; and for a time it looked as if he
might win.</p>

<p>However, in the end the "apostles" had their way,
and the adroit Young was elected to the headship of
the church. Strang at once called forth his followers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
and in April, 1845, planted the "City of Voree" upon
a prairie by the side of White River, in Walworth
county, Wisconsin. It soon became a town of nearly
two thousand inhabitants, who owned all things in common,
but were ruled over, even in the smallest affairs
of life, by the wily President Strang, who claimed to
be divinely instructed in every detail of his rigorous
government.</p>

<p>The people dwelt "in plain houses, in board shanties,
in tents, and sometimes, many of them, in the open air."
Great meetings were held at Voree, and the surrounding
settlers gathered to hear Strang and his twelve
"apostles" lay down the law, and tell of the revelations
which had been delivered to them by the Almighty.
Strang, who closely imitated the methods of Joseph,
pretended to discover the word of God in deep-hidden
records. Joseph had found the Book of Mormon
graven upon plates dug out of the hill of Cumorah, in
New York; so Strang discovered buried near Voree
similar brazen plates bearing revelations, written in the
rhythmic style of the Scriptures, which supplemented
those in the Book of Mormon.</p>

<p>President Strang was a very busy man as the head
of the Voree branch of the Mormon church. He obtained
a printing outfit, and published a little weekly
paper called <i>Gospel Herald</i>, besides hundreds of pamphlets,
all written by himself, in which he assailed the
"Brighamites" in the same violent manner as they
attacked him in their numerous publications. He also,
with his missionaries, conducted meetings in Ohio, New
York, and other States in the East, gathering converts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
for Voree, and boldly repelling the wordy attacks of
the Brighamites, whose agents were working the same
fields.</p>

<p>Despite some backslidings, and occasional quarrels
within its ranks, Voree grew and prospered. By 1849
there was a partially built stone temple there, which is
thus described by an imaginative letter writer of the
time: "It covers two and one-sixth acres of ground,
has twelve towers, and the great hall two hundred feet
square in the center. The entire walls are eight feet
through, the floors and roofs are to be marble, and when
finished it will be the grandest building in the world."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it was early seen by Strang that the
growing opposition of neighboring settlers would in
the end cause the Mormons to leave Wisconsin, just
as the Nauvoo fanatics were compelled (in 1846) to flee
from Illinois, to plant their stake in the wilderness of the
Far West.</p>

<p>He therefore made preparations for a place of refuge
for his people, when persecutions should become unbearable.
In journeying by vessel, upon one of his missions,
he had taken note of the isolation of an archipelago of
large, beautiful, well-wooded islands near the foot of
Lake Michigan. The month of May, 1846, found him
with four companions upon Beaver Island, in this far-away
group. They built a log cabin, arranged for a
boat, and returned to Voree to prepare for the migration
of the faithful.</p>

<p>The new colony at first grew slowly, but by the summer
of 1849 the "saints" began to arrive in goodly
numbers. Strang himself now headed the settlement;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
and thereafter Voree ceased to be headquarters for the
"Primitive Mormons," as they called themselves,
although a few remained in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Very soon, about two thousand devotees were
gathered within the "City of St. James," on Beaver
Island, with well-tilled farms, neat houses, a sawmill,
roads, docks, and a large temple. A hill near by they
renamed Mount Pisgah, and a River Jordan and a Sea
of Galilee were not far away.</p>

<p>One beautiful day in July, 1850, Strang, arrayed in a
robe of bright red, was, with much ceremony, crowned
by his "apostles" as "King of the Kingdom of St.
James." Foreign ambassadors were appointed, and a
royal press was set up, for the flaying of his enemies.
Schools and debating clubs were opened; the community
system was abolished; tithes were collected for
the support of the government; tea, coffee, and tobacco
were prohibited; and even the dress of the people was
regulated by law. Never was there a king more absolute
than Strang; doubtless, for a time, he thought
his dream of empire realized at last, and that here in
this unknown corner of the world the "saints" might
remain forever unmolested.</p>

<p>But the sylvan archipelago, and Beaver
Island itself, had other inhabitants;
these were rude,
sturdy, illiterate fishermen,
who lived in
huts along the coast,
and had little patience
with the fantastic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
performances of their neighbors, King Strang
and the court of St. James. His majesty had, also,
jealous enemies among his own subjects.</p>

<p>Trouble soon ensued. The fishermen frequently
assaulted the "saints," and carried on a petty warfare
against the colony at large, in which the county sheriff
was soon engaged; for false charges came to be entered
against these strange but inoffensive people, and they
were now and then thrown into jail. The king, thereupon,
in self-defence, "went into politics." Having so
many votes at his command, he easily secured the election
of Mormons to all the county offices, and of himself
to the legislature of Michigan.</p>

<p>But despite these victories over outside foes, matters
at home went from bad to worse. The enemies in his
camp multiplied, for his increasingly despotic rule gave
them abundance of grievances. At last, about the middle
of June, 1856, two of the malcontents shot their
monarch from behind. He was taken by vessel to his
old home in Voree, where he was tenderly cared for
until his death, a month later, by his poor, neglected
wife, who had remained behind when he went forth to
the island. His kingdom did not long survive him.
The unruly fishermen came one day with ax and torch,
leveled the royal city to the ground, and banished the
frightened "saints."</p>

<p>To-day the White River prairie gives no evidence of
having once borne the city of Zion, and even in the
Michigan archipelago there remain few visible relics of
the marvelous reign of King Strang.</p>

<h2 id="THE_WISCONSIN_BOURBON">THE WISCONSIN BOURBON</h2>

<p>Two years after Louis the XVI., Bourbon king
of France, and his beautiful queen, Marie Antoinette,
were beheaded by the revolutionists in Paris, in
the closing decade of the eighteenth century, their
imbecile child of eight years, called the "dauphin,"
was officially reported to have died in prison. But the
story was started at the time, and popularly believed,
that the real dauphin, Louis the XVII., had been
stolen by the royalists, and another child cunningly
substituted to die there in his place. The story went
that the dauphin had been sent to America, and that
all traces of him were lost; thus was given to any adventurer
of the requisite age, and sufficiently obscure
birth, an opportunity to seek such honor as might be
gained in claiming identity with the escaped prisoner.</p>

<p>Great was the excitement in the United States, when,
in 1853, it was confidently announced by a New York
magazine writer that the long lost prince had at last
been discovered, in the person of the middle-aged Eleazer
Williams, an Episcopal missionary to the Oneida
Indians at Little Kaukauna, in the lower valley of the
Fox.</p>

<p>The Bonaparte family, represented by Louis Napoleon,
were just then in control of France; but the Bourbon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
family, of which Louis the XVII., were he
alive, would naturally be the head, considered themselves
rightful hereditary masters of that country. Of
course, there was at the time no opportunity for any
Bourbon actually to occupy the French throne; but the
people of that country are highly emotional, revolutions
have been numerous among them, and displaced royalists
are always hoping for some turn in affairs which
may enable them once more to gain the government.
It was this possible chance of the Bourbons getting into
power once more, that added interest to the story.</p>

<p>Let us see what sort of person this Eleazer Williams
of Wisconsin was, and how it came about that he made
the assertion that he was the head of the Bourbons, and
an uncrowned king. It had heretofore been supposed
by every one who knew him that he was the son of
Mohawk Indian parents, both of whom had white blood
in their veins, living just over the New York border, in
Canada. Certain Congregationalists had induced this
couple to allow two of their sons, Thomas and Eleazer,
to be educated in New England as missionaries to the
Indians; and for several years they attended academies
there, becoming fairly proficient in English, although
their aboriginal manners were not much improved.</p>

<p>At last returning to his Canadian home, Eleazer neglected
his Congregational benefactors, and soon became
interested in the Episcopal Church. He would have
become one of its missionaries at once, but just at that
time the War of 1812-15 broke out; and instead he
became a spy in the pay of the United States, conveying
to his employers important information concerning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
the movements of British troops in Canada. When the
war was over, having, as an American spy, incurred the
dislike of the Canadian Mohawks, he was sent as an
Episcopal missionary to the Oneida Indians, then living
in Oneida county, New York.</p>

<p>Williams appears to have differed from the ordinary
Indian type, although he was thickset, dark haired,
and swarthy of skin. Some took him to be a Spaniard;
others there were who thought him French; and comments
which he had heard, concerning his slight resemblance
to the pictures of the Bourbons, doubtless
caused Eleazer in later years to pretend to be the lost
dauphin. He was a fair orator, and in his earlier years
succeeded well in persuading the simple red men about
him. His plausible manner, and this ease of persuasion,
finally led him astray.</p>

<p>The Oneida Indians in New York and their neighbors
(formerly from New England), the Munsees, Stockbridges,
and Brothertowns, were just then being crowded
out of that State. A great company had acquired the
right from the federal government to purchase the lands
held by these Indians, whenever they cared to dispose
of them. In order to hurry matters, the company
began to sow among the poor natives the seeds of
discontent.</p>

<p>Certain of their leaders, among them Williams, advocated
emigration to the West. It appears that Williams,
who was a born intriguer, conceived the ambitious
idea of taking advantage of this movement to establish
an Indian empire in the country west of Lake Michigan,
with himself as dictator.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span></p>

<p>Moved by the clamor of the red men, the federal
government sent a delegation to Wisconsin, in 1820, to
see whether the tribes west of the lake would consent
to accept the New York Indians as neighbors. This
delegation was headed by Dr. Jedediah Morse, a celebrated
geographer and missionary. Morse visited
Mackinac and Green Bay, and returned with the report
that the valley of the lower Fox was the most suitable
place in which to make a settlement. That very summer,
Williams himself, with several other headmen, had
on their own account journeyed as far as Detroit on
a similar errand, but returned without discovering a
location.</p>

<p>The owners of the land selected by Morse were the
Menominees and Winnebagoes, with whom Williams
and his followers held a council at Green Bay, the following
year. A treaty was signed, by which the New
York Indians were granted a large strip of land, four
miles wide, at Little Chute.</p>

<p>The ensuing year (1822), at a new council held at
Green Bay, the New Yorkers asked for still more land.
The Winnebagoes, much incensed, withdrew from the
treaty, but the Menominees were won over by Williams's
eloquence, and granted an extraordinary cession, making
the New York Indians joint owners with themselves
of all Menominee territory, which then embraced very
nearly a half of all the present State of Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Ten years of quarreling followed, for there was at
once a reaction from this remarkable spirit of generosity.
In 1832 there was concluded a final treaty, apparently
satisfactory to most of those concerned, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
soon thereafter a large number of New York Indians
removed hither. The Oneidas and Munsees established
themselves upon Duck Creek, near the mouth of the
Fox, and the Stockbridges and Brothertowns east of
Lake Winnebago. As for Williams, the jealousies and
bickerings among his people soon caused him to lose
control over them, thus giving the deathblow to his
wild dreams of empire.</p>

<div id="i20018">&nbsp;</div>

<p>During the next twenty years, in which he continued
to serve as a missionary to the Wisconsin Oneidas,
Williams was a well-known
and picturesque character.
His home was
on the west bank
of the river, about a
mile below Little Kaukauna.
Although a man
of much vigor and strength of mind, he soon came to
be recognized as an unscrupulous fellow by the majority
of both whites and reds in the lower Fox, and
his clerical brethren, East as well as West, appear to
have regarded him with more or less contempt.</p>

<p>Baffled in several fields of notoriety which he had
worked, Williams suddenly posed before the American
public, in 1853, as the hereditary sovereign of France.
He was too young by eight years to be the lost dauphin;
that he was clearly of Indian origin was proved
by a close examination of his color, form, and feature;
his dusky parents protested under oath that the wayward
Eleazer was their son; every allegation of his in
regard to the matter has often been exposed as false;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
and all his neighbors who knew him treated his claims
as fraudulent.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he succeeded in deceiving a number of
good people, including several leading clergymen of his
church; one of the latter attempted in an elaborate
book, "The Lost Prince," to prove conclusively that
Williams was indeed the son of the executed monarch.</p>

</div>

<p>The pretensions of Eleazer Williams, who dearly
loved the notoriety which this discussion awakened,
extended through several years. They even won some
little attention in France, but far less than here, for
several other men had claimed to be the lost dauphin, so
that the pretension was not a new one over there. Louis
Philippe, the head of the Bourbon-Orleans family in
France, sent him a present of some finely bound books,
believing him the innocent victim of a delusion; but,
further than that, and a chance meeting at Green Bay,
between Eleazer Williams and another French royalist,
the Prince de Joinville, then on his travels through
America, the family in France paid no attention to the
adventurous half-breed American Indian who claimed
to be one of them.</p>

<p>The reputation of Williams as a missionary had at
last fallen so low, and the neglect of his duties was so
persistent, that his salary was withdrawn by the Episcopal
Church, and his closing years were spent in
poverty. He died in 1858, maintaining his absurd
claims to the last.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span></p>

<h2 id="SLAVE_CATCHING_IN_WISCONSIN">SLAVE CATCHING IN WISCONSIN</h2>

<p>There had been a few negro slaves in Wisconsin
before the organization of the Territory and during
Territorial days. They had for the most part
been brought in by lead miners from Kentucky and
Missouri. But, as the population increased, it was
seen that public opinion here, as in most of the free
States, was strongly opposed to the practice of holding
human beings as chattels. Gradually the dozen
or more slaves were returned to the South, or died
in service, or were freed by their masters; so that, at
an early day, the slavery question had ceased to be
of local importance here.</p>

<p>As the years passed on, and the people of the
North became more and more opposed to the slave
system of the South, the latter lost an increasing
number of its slaves through escape to Canada. They
were assisted in their flight by Northern sympathizers,
who, secretly receiving them on the north
bank of the Ohio River, passed them on from friend
to friend until they reached the Canadian border. As
this system of escape was contrary to law, it had to
be conducted, by both white rescuers and black fugitives,
with great privacy, often with much peril to
life; hence it received the significant, popular name<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
of "The Underground Railroad." Wisconsin had but
small part in the working of the underground railroad,
because it was not upon the usual highway
between the South and Canada. But our people took
a firm stand on the matter, sympathizing with the
fugitive slaves and those who aided them on their
way to freedom.</p>

<p>When, therefore, Congress, in 1850, at the bidding
of the Southern politicians, passed the Fugitive Slave
Law, Wisconsin bitterly condemned it. This act was
designed to crush out the underground railroad. It
provided for the appointment, by federal courts, of
commissioners in the several States, whose duty it
should be to assist slaveholders and their agents in
catching their runaway property. The unsupported
testimony of the owner or agent was sufficient to
prove ownership, the black man himself having no
right to testify, and there being for him no trial by
jury. The United States commissioners might enforce
the law by the aid of any number of assistants,
and, in the last resort, might summon the entire
population to help them. There were very heavy
penalties provided for violations of this inhuman law.</p>

<p>The Fugitive Slave Law was denounced by most of
the political conventions held in our State that year.
In his message to the legislature, in January, 1851,
Governor Dewey expressed the general sentiment when
he said that it "contains provisions odious to our people,
contrary to our sympathies, and repugnant to our
feelings." But it was three years before occasion
arose for Wisconsin to act.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span></p>

<p>In the early months of 1854, a negro named Joshua
Glover appeared in Racine, and obtained work in a
sawmill four miles north of that place. On the night
of the 10th of March, he was playing cards in his
little cabin, with two other men
of his race. Suddenly there
appeared at the door seven
well-armed white men,&mdash;two
United States
deputy marshals from
Milwaukee, their four
assistants from Racine,
and a St.
Louis man named
Garland, who
claimed to be Glover's
owner.</p>

<div id="i20417">&nbsp;</div>
<div id="i20418">&nbsp;</div>
<div id="i20419">&nbsp;</div>

<p>A desperate
struggle followed,
the result being that
Glover, deserted by
his comrades and
knocked senseless by
a blow, was placed in
chains by his captors.</p>

<p>Severely bleeding from his wounds, he was
thrown into an open wagon and carted across country
to the Milwaukee county jail, for the man hunters
feared to go to Racine, where the antislavery feeling
was strong. It was a bitter cold night, and Glover's
miseries were added to by the brutal Garland, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
at intervals kicked and beat the prisoner, and promised
him still more serious punishment upon their
return to the Missouri plantation.</p>

<p>The news of the capture was not long in reaching
Racine. The next morning there was held in the city
square a public meeting, attended by nearly every
citizen, at which resolutions were passed denouncing
the act of the kidnapers as an outrage; demanding
for Glover a trial by jury; promising "to attend in
person to aid him, by all honorable means, to secure
his unconditional release"; and, most significant of all,
resolving that the people of Racine "do hereby declare
the slave catching law of 1850 disgraceful and
also repealed." There were many such nullifying
resolutions passed in those stirring days by mass meetings
throughout the country, but this was one of the
earliest and most outspoken. That afternoon, on hearing
where Glover had been imprisoned, a hundred
indignant citizens of Racine, headed by the sheriff,
went by steamer to Milwaukee, arriving there at five
o'clock.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Milwaukee had been active. News of
the capture had not been circulated in that city until
eleven o'clock in the morning. One of the first to
learn of it was Sherman M. Booth, the energetic editor
of a small antislavery paper, the <i>Wisconsin Free Democrat</i>.
Riding up and down the streets upon a horse,
he scattered handbills, and, stopping at each crossing,
shouted: "Freemen, to the rescue! Slave catchers are
in our midst! Be at the courthouse at two o'clock!"</p>

<p>Prompt to the hour, over five thousand people assembled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
in the courthouse square, where Booth and several
other "liberty men" made impassioned speeches. A
vigilance committee was appointed, to see that Glover
had a fair trial, and the county judge issued in his
behalf a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, calling for an immediate
trial, and a show of proofs. But the federal judge,
A. G. Miller, forbade the sheriff to obey this writ, holding
that Glover must remain in the hands of the United
States marshal, in whose custody he was placed by virtue
of the Fugitive Slave Law.</p>

<p>The local militia were called out to suppress the disorder,
but they were without power. It soon became
noised about that Glover was to be secretly removed to
Missouri. This made the mob furious. Just at this
time the Racine contingent arrived, adding oil to the
flames. The re&euml;nforced crowd now marched to the jail,
attacked the weak structure with axes, beams, and
crowbars, rescued the fugitive just at sunset, and
hurried him off. An underground railroad agency took
the poor fellow in charge, and soon placed him aboard
a sailing vessel bound for Canada, where he finally
arrived in safety.</p>

<p>Throughout Wisconsin the rescue was approved by
the newspapers and public gatherings. Sympathetic
meetings were also held in other States, at which resolutions
applauding the action of Booth and his friends,
and declaring the slave catching law unconstitutional,
were passed with much enthusiasm. There was also
held at Milwaukee, in April, a notable State convention,
with delegates from all of the settled parts of the
commonwealth; this convention declared the law unconstitutional,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
and formed a State league for furnishing
aid and sympathy to the Glover rescuers.</p>

<p>In 1857, as a result of the Glover affair, the Wisconsin
legislature passed an act making it a duty of
district attorneys in each county "to use all lawful
means to protect, defend, and procure to be discharged
... every person arrested or claimed as a fugitive
slave," and throwing around the poor fellow every
possible safeguard. Such was Wisconsin's final protest
against the iniquity of the Fugitive Slave Law.</p>

<p>Naturally, Booth had been looked upon by the
United States marshal as the chief abettor of the
riot. He was promptly arrested for violating a federal
law by aiding in the escape of a slave; but the State
supreme court promptly discharged him on a writ of
<i>habeas corpus</i>. Thereupon he was brought before the
federal court, but again the State court interfered in
his favor, because of a technical irregularity.</p>

<p>On the first of these occasions, the State court issued
a very remarkable decision upon State rights, that attracted
national attention at a time when this question
was violently agitating the public mind. It declared,
after a clear, logical statement of the case, that the
Fugitive Slave Law was "unconstitutional and void"
because it conferred judicial power upon mere court
commissioners, and deprived the accused negro of the
right of trial by jury. One of the justices of the
court, in an individual opinion, went still further: he
held that Congress had no power to legislate upon this
subject; that "the States will never quietly submit to
be disrobed of their sovereignty" by "national functionaries";<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
that the police power rested in the State
itself, which would not "succumb, paralyzed and aghast,
before the process of an officer unknown to the constitution,
and irresponsible to its sanctions"; and that so
long as he remained a judge, Wisconsin would meet
such attempts with "stern remonstrance and resistance."</p>

<p>The federal court reversed this action, and again
arrested Booth in 1860, but he was soon pardoned by
the President, and met with no further trouble on
account of the Glover affair.</p>

<p>As for the people of Racine, they made life rather
uncomfortable for the men who had assisted the Milwaukee
deputy marshals in arresting Glover. The city
became a fiercer hotbed of abolition than ever before,
and several times thereafter aided slaves to escape from
bondage. Fortunately for their own good, as well as
for the cause of law and order, they found no further
occasion to take the law into their own hands, in the
defense of human liberty.</p>

<h2 id="THE_STORY_OF_A_FAMOUS_CHIEF">THE STORY OF A FAMOUS CHIEF</h2>

<p>One of the best-known Indians with whom Wisconsin
Territorial pioneers were thrown into personal
contact was Oshkosh, the last of the Menominee
sachems, or peace chiefs. It is worth while briefly
to relate the story of his career, because it was the
life of a typical Indian leader, at the critical time
when the whites were coming into the country in such
numbers as to crowd the reds to the wall.</p>

<p>Oshkosh was born in 1795, at Point Bas, on the Wisconsin
River. Cha-kau-cho-ka-ma (meaning Old King),
the peace chief of the Menominees at that time, was
his maternal grandfather. The war chief was Glode,
the orator of the tribe, and a mighty hunter. The
Old King lived until 1826, but Glode died in 1804,
his successor being Tomah (the French pronunciation
of Thomas, his English name).</p>

<p>In the War of 1812-15, a large band of Wisconsin
Indians joined the ranks of Tecumseh, in raiding upon
the American borderers. The principal Menominee
chiefs were Tomah, Souligny, Grizzly Bear, and Iometah,
and among the young men was Oshkosh.</p>

<p>Their first expedition was against Fort Mackinac, in
1812, that stronghold being captured from the Americans<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
without bloodshed. Among white men, such an
enterprise would not seem to offer much opportunity
for the display of personal bravery; but savage and
civilized standards of courage differ, and young Oshkosh
appears to have satisfied the old men upon this
occasion, so that he then received the name by which
we know him, meaning in the Menominee tongue,
"brave."</p>

<p>By the following May, Oshkosh, now in his nineteenth
year, and prominent among the young warriors,
went out with Souligny and Tomah, and joined Tecumseh
in the siege of Fort Meigs at the rapids of the
Maumee River. Later, during the same summer, he
was engaged in the memorable British-Indian siege of
Sandusky. The succeeding year he was one of a large
party of Menominees assisting the British to repel a
fierce but futile American attempt to recapture Fort
Mackinac. This was his last campaign, for peace
between Great Britain and the United States soon followed.</p>

<p>Oshkosh, now living upon the lands of the tribe in
northeastern Wisconsin, appears to have passed a quiet
existence, after his exploits of 1812-15. Lacking the
stimulus of war, he maintained a state of artificial
excitement by the use of fire water, and soon won a bad
reputation in this regard. But he was not wholly debased.
Few in council had more power than he.
Although he was slow to speak, his opinion when
given had much weight, because of a firm, resolute
tone, beside which the impassioned flights of Tomah
and Souligny often failed in effect.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span></p>

<p>When the Old King died without any sons, a contest
arose over the successorship to the chieftaincy. In
many tribes there would have been no question about
the election of Oshkosh, for he was the son
of Old King's daughter; but the Menominees
did not recognize
any heirship except
through sons. So many
claimants arose, each
determined to fight for
the position, that the
United States government
feared an outbreak
of civil war
within the tribe, with
possible injuries to
the neighboring white
settlers.</p>

<p>Hence a court of
claims was organized,
to choose a chief
among the contestants.
This court,
headed by Governor
Lewis Cass, of Michigan
Territory, met at
Little Butte des Morts (near Neenah) in August, 1827,
and selected Oshkosh. Cass, in the presence of the
tribesmen, hung a medal about the neck of the victor,
shook hands with him, and ordered a feast in honor of
the event.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span></p>

<p>The first five years of the reign of this dusky chieftain
were peaceful enough, so far as relations with other
tribes were concerned. But within the Menominee villages
there were frequent drunken frolics, which sometimes
ended in bloodshed or in endless disputes between
families; and in these disturbances, which often greatly
alarmed the white settlers, Oshkosh had his full
share.</p>

<p>When in June, 1832, the great Sac leader, Black
Hawk, was harassing the settlements in northern Illinois
and southern Wisconsin, while being slowly driven
northward by the white troops, fears were entertained
in the valley of the lower Fox that he would turn
toward Green Bay. With the hope of preventing this,
a force of three hundred Menominee Indians was
recruited there, and sent to the seat of war, officered
by American and French residents. Oshkosh headed
his people, but arrived too late to do any fighting;
Black Hawk had already been vanquished by white
soldiers, at the battle of the Bad Ax. Oshkosh and his
braves found no more savage foe than a small party of
Sacs, old men and women and children, flying from the
battlefield, and these they promptly massacred, proudly
carrying the scalps back with them to Green Bay.</p>

<p>Four years later, the Menominees sold all of their
lands in Wisconsin to the federal government, and
were placed upon the reservation at Keshena, where
they still live.</p>

<p>In 1840, the little four-year-old white settlement at
the junction of the upper Fox with Lake Winnebago
thought itself large enough to have a post office, hence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
the necessity for adopting a permanent name. The
place had at first been known to travelers as Stanley's
Tavern, because here a man named Stanley ran a ferry
across Fox River, and kept a log hotel. Then the
Green Bay merchants fell into the habit of marking
"Athens" on boxes and bales which the boatmen carried
up to Stanley's.</p>

<p>When the question arose over the name for the
post office, there were several candidates, "Osceola,"
"Galeopolis," and "Athens" being prominent. Robert
Grignon, a French fur trader at Grand Butte des
Morts, desiring to be on good terms with his Menominee
neighbors, proposed "Oshkosh." Thereupon party
spirit ran high. Upon a day named, a popular election
without distinction of race was held at the office of
the justice of the peace, who provided a free dinner to
the voters; among them were a score of Indians,
brought in by Grignon. Several ballots were taken,
between which speeches were made in behalf of the
rivals. "Oshkosh" finally won, chiefly by the votes
of Grignon's Indians. Harmony was soon restored,
and the election ended in drink and smoke, after the
fashion of border gatherings in those days.</p>

<p>We hear little more of old chief Oshkosh, until fifteen
years later. In the year 1852 occurred a kidnaping
case, which became famous in the frontier annals of
Wisconsin. Nahkom, a Menominee squaw, was accused
of having stolen a little white boy, the son of Alvin Partridge,
of the town of Neenah, in Winnebago county.
The Indians stoutly denied the truth of this accusation;
indeed, Partridge himself failed to recognize his lost son<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
in the person of Nahkom's boy. But the relatives and
neighbors of Partridge were confident as to the identity,
and the bereaved father was induced to ask aid of the
courts in obtaining the child.</p>

<p>The case hung fire for three years, the courts always
deciding in favor of Nahkom, although Partridge regained
temporary possession of the boy under writs of
<i>habeas corpus</i>. Finally, pending the decision of a Milwaukee
judge upon the application for a writ, the little
fellow was placed in the jail of that city. From there
the Partridges kidnaped him and fled to Kansas, leaving
poor Nahkom childless, for undoubtedly it was a case of
mistaken identity, and the child was really hers. Ultimately
the boy was found and restored to her.</p>

<p>This was in 1855. Oshkosh and a number of Menominee
headmen went at once to Milwaukee, upon
learning of the jail delivery, and laid their complaints
before the judge. Recognizing the press as a medium
of communication with the public, Oshkosh and Souligny
also visited the editor of the <i>Sentinel</i>, asking him
to state their grievance and plead their cause. The
speech which Oshkosh made to the editor was given in
full in that paper, and is a good specimen of the direct,
earnest method in Indian oratory.</p>

<p>He said, among other things: "Governor Dodge told
us that our great father [the President] was very strong,
and owned all the country; and that no one would dare
to trouble us, or do us wrong, as he would protect us.
He told us, too, that whenever we got into difficulty or
anything happened we did not like, to call on our great
father and he would see justice done. And now we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
come to you to remind our great father, through your
paper, of his promise, and to ask him to fulfil it....
We thought our child safe in the jail in the care of the
officers; that none could get the child away from them
unless the law gave them the right. We cannot but
think it must have been an evil spirit that got into the
jail and took away our child. We thought the white
man's law strong, and are sorry to find it so weak."
Upon the conclusion of his visit, Oshkosh and his
friends returned to their reservation, determined never
again to mingle with the deceitful and grasping whites.</p>

<p>Upon their way home to Keshena, Oshkosh stopped
at the thriving little city which had been christened
for him, and expressed pride at having so large a namesake.
It was his first and only visit. Three years later
he died in a drunken brawl, aged sixty-three years. He
was a good Indian, as savages go, his chief vice being
one borrowed from the whites, who forced themselves
upon his lands and contaminated him and his people.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span></p>

<h2 id="A_FIGHT_FOR_THE_GOVERNORSHIP">A FIGHT FOR THE GOVERNORSHIP</h2>

<p>Between the time when Wisconsin became a
state (1848), and the opening of the War of
Secession (1861), party feeling ran high within the
new commonwealth. Charges of corruption against
public officials were freely made; many men sought
office for the plunder supposed to be obtained by
those "inside the ring"; newspaper editors appeared
to be chiefly engaged in savage attacks on the reputations
of those who differed from them, and general
political demoralization was prevalent. When, however,
important issues arose out of the discussions of
the strained relations between North and South, a
higher and more patriotic tone was at once evident,
and this has ever since been maintained in Wisconsin
politics.</p>

<p>The most striking event of the years of petty partisan
strife which preceded the war, was the fight for
the governorship of the State, between William A.
Barstow and Coles Bashford.</p>

<p>Barstow, a Democrat from Waukesha county, had
been secretary of state during Governor Dewey's second
term (1850-51). Owing to bitterness occasioned
by the rejection of the first State constitution, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
Democratic party in Wisconsin was torn into factions,
at the head of one of which was Barstow. While serving
as secretary of state, he made
many enemies, who freely accused
him of rank official dishonesty, and
associated him with the corrupt
methods of the early railway companies
which were just then seeking
charters from the legislature.
Nevertheless, like all strong, positive
men, he had won for himself warm
friends, who secured his election as
governor for the year 1854-55.</p>

<p class="caption splitr">
COLES BASHFORD
</p>

<p>His enemies, however, grew in number, and their
accusations increased in bitterness. His party renominated
him for governor; but he had lost ground during
the term, and could not draw out his full party strength
in the November election of 1855. Besides, the new
Republican party, although as
yet in the minority, was making
rapid strides, and voted solidly
for its nominee, Bashford, a Winnebago
county lawyer. As a
result, the voting for governor
proved so close that for a full
month no one knew the outcome.
Meanwhile there was, of course,
much popular excitement, with
charges of fraud on both sides.</p>

<p>Finally, in December, the State board of canvassers
met at Madison. It consisted of the secretary of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
state, the State treasurer, and the attorney-general, all
of them Barstow men. Their report was that he had
received one hundred fifty-seven more votes than his
opponent. The Republicans at once advanced the
serious charge that the canvassers had deliberately
forged supplemental returns from several counties, pretending
to receive them upon the day before the count.
Large numbers of people soon came to believe that
fraud had been committed, and Bashford prepared for
a contest.</p>

<p>Upon the day in early January when Barstow was
inaugurated at the capitol, with the usual military display,
Bashford stepped into the supreme court room
and was quietly sworn in by the chief justice. Thereupon
Bashford appealed to the court to turn Barstow
out, and declare him the rightful governor.</p>

<div>

</div>

<p class="caption split">
WILLIAM A. BARSTOW
</p>

<p>There followed a most remarkable lawsuit. The
constitution provides that the State government shall
consist of three branches, legislative, judicial, and
executive. It was claimed that never before in the history
of any of the States in the Union had one branch
of the government been called upon to decide between
rival claimants to a position in another branch. Barstow's
lawyers, of course, denied the jurisdiction of the
court to pass upon the right of the governor to hold
his seat; for, they argued, if this were possible, then
the judiciary would be superior to the people, and
no one could hold office to whom the judges were not
friendly. There was a fierce struggle, for several
weeks, between the opposing lawyers, who were among
the most learned men of the State, with the result<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
that the court decided that it had jurisdiction; and, on
nearly every point raised, ruled in favor of the Bashford
men.</p>

<p>Before the decision of the case, Barstow and his
lawyers withdrew, declaring that the judges were influenced
against them by political prejudices. However,
the court proceeded without them, and declared
that the election returns had been tampered with, and
that Bashford really had one thousand nine majority.
He was accordingly declared to have been elected
governor.</p>

<p>This conclusion had been expected by Barstow, who,
determined not to be put out of office, resigned his
position three days before the court rendered its decision.
Immediately upon Barstow's resignation, his
friend, the lieutenant governor, Arthur McArthur, took
possession of the office. He claimed that he was now
the rightful governor, for the constitution provides that
in the event of the resignation, death, or inability of
the governor, the lieutenant governor shall succeed
him. But the supreme court at once ruled that, as
Barstow's title was worthless, McArthur could not succeed
to it, a logical view of the case which the Barstow
sympathizers had not foreseen.</p>

<p>It was upon Monday, March the 24th, that the court
rendered its decision. Bashford announced that he
would take possession of the office upon Tuesday.
There had been great popular uneasiness in Madison
and the neighboring country, throughout the long struggle,
and the decision brought this excitement to a crisis.
Many of the adherents of both contestants armed themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
and drilled, in anticipation of an encounter which
might lead to civil war within the State. There were
frequent wordy quarrels upon the streets, and threats
of violence; and many supposed that it would be impossible
to prevent the opposing factions from fighting
in good earnest.</p>

<p>Affairs were in this critical condition upon the fateful
Tuesday. Early in the day people began to arrive in
Madison from the surrounding country, as if for a popular
f&ecirc;te. The streets and the capitol grounds were filled
with excited men, chiefly adherents of Bashford; they
cheered him loudly as he emerged from the supreme
court room, at eleven o'clock, accompanied by the
sheriff of the county, who held in his hand the order
which awarded the office to Bashford.</p>

<p>Passing through the corridors of the capitol, now
crowded with his friends, Bashford and the sheriff
rapped upon the door of the governor's office. McArthur
and several of his friends were inside; a voice
bade the callers enter. The new governor was a large,
pleasant-looking man. Leisurely taking off his coat
and hat, he hung them in the wardrobe, and calmly
informed McArthur that he had come to occupy the
governor's chair.</p>

<p>"Is force to be used in supporting the order of the
court?" indignantly asked the incumbent, as, glancing
through the open door, he caught sight of the eager,
excited crowd of Bashford's friends, whose leaders with
difficulty restrained them from at once crowding into
the room.</p>

<p>"I presume," blandly replied Bashford, "that no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
force will be essential; but in case any is needed,
there will be no hesitation whatever in applying it,
with the sheriff's help."</p>

<p>McArthur at once calmed down, said that he "considered
this threat as constructive force," and promptly
left his rival in possession. As he hurried out, through
rows of his political enemies, the corridors were ringing
with shouts of triumph; and in a few moments Bashford
was shaking hands with the crowd, who, in the
highest glee, swarmed through his office.</p>

<p>The legislature was divided in political sentiment.
The senate received the new governor's message with
enthusiasm, and by formal resolution congratulated him
upon his success. The assembly at first refused, thirty-eight
to thirty-four, to have anything to do with him;
but upon thirty of the Democrats withdrawing, after
filing a protest against the action of the court, the
house agreed, thirty-seven to nine, to recognize Governor
Bashford. Thereafter he had no trouble at the
helm of State.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span></p>

<h2 id="OUR_FOREIGN-BORN_CITIZENS">OUR FOREIGN-BORN CITIZENS</h2>

<p>It is probable that no other State in the Union contains
so many varieties of Europeans as does Wisconsin.
About seventeen per cent of our entire population were
born in Germany; next in numbers come the Scandinavians,
natives of Great Britain, Irish, Canadians, Poles,
Bohemians, Hollanders, Russians, and French.</p>

<p>These different nationalities are scattered all over the
State; often they are found grouped in very large neighborhoods.
Sometimes one of these groups is so large
that, with the American-born children, it occupies entire
townships, and practically controls the local churches
and schools, which are generally conducted in the foreign
tongue. There are extensive German, Scandinavian,
and Welsh farming districts in our State where
one may travel far without hearing English spoken by
any one. Some crowded quarters of Milwaukee are
wholly German in custom and language; and there are
other streets in that city where few but Poles, Bohemians,
or Russians can be found.</p>

<p>Although these foreign-born people, as is quite natural,
generally cling with tenacity to the language, the
religion, and many of the customs in which they were
reared, it is noticeable that all of them are eager to learn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
our methods of government, and to become good citizens;
and their children, when allowed to mingle freely
with the youth of this country, become so thoroughly
Americanized that little if any difference can be distinguished
between them and those whose forefathers have
lived here for several generations past.</p>

<p>There is, however, hardly a family in Wisconsin which
is not of European origin. Some of us are descended
from ancestors who chanced to come to the New World
at an earlier period than did the ancestors of others of
our fellow-citizens; that is all that distinguishes these
"old American families" from those more recently
transplanted.</p>

<p>It is a very interesting study to watch the gradual
evolution of a new American race from the mingling
on our soil of so many different nationalities, just as
the English race itself was slowly built up from the old
Britons, Saxons, Norsemen, and Norman French. But
we must remember that this "race amalgamation,"
although now proceeding upon a larger scale than
was probably ever witnessed before, has always been
going on in America since the earliest colonial days,
when English, French, Hollanders, Swedes, Scotch, and
Irish were fused as in a melting pot, for the production
of the American types that we meet to-day.</p>

<p>A variety of reasons induced foreigners to come to
Wisconsin in such large numbers; they may, however,
be classified under three heads, political, economic, and
religious. The political reason was dissatisfaction with
the government at home, chiefly because it repressed
all aspiration for liberty and forced young men to sacrifice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
several of the best years of their lives by spending
them in the army. The most powerful economic reason
was inability to earn a satisfactory living in the fatherland,
because worn-out soils, low prices for produce,
overcrowding of population, and excessive competition
among workmen resulted in starvation wages. The religious
reason was the disposition of European monarchs
to interfere with men's right to worship God as
they pleased.</p>

<p>In 1830 there were serious political troubles in Germany,
and thousands of dissatisfied people emigrated
from that country to America. Many of the newcomers
were young professional men of fine education and lofty
ideals. In those early days American society was somewhat
crude, especially upon the frontier. These spirited
young Germans complained that, both in religion and
politics, the life of our people was sordid and low, with
little appreciation for the higher things of life; and especially
did they resent our popular lack of appreciation
of their countrymen.</p>

<p>Therefore, in 1835, there was formed in New York a
society called "Germania," which was to induce enough
Germans to settle in some one of the American States
to be able to gain control of it and make it a German
State, with German life and manners, with German
schools, literature, and art, with German courts and
assemblies, and with German as the official language.
A great deal of discussion followed, as to which State
should be chosen; some preferred Texas, others Oregon,
but most of the members wished some State in what
was then called the Northwest, between the Great Lakes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
and the Mississippi River. The society disbanded without
result; but the agitation to which it gave rise was continued
throughout many years on both sides of the ocean.</p>

<p>Wisconsin was strongly favored by most of the German
writers on immigration, especially about the time
that it became prominent through being admitted to
the Union (1848). Nothing came of all this agitation
for a German State, except the very wide advertising
which Wisconsin obtained in Germany, as a State admirably
suited for Germans, in soil, climate, liberal constitution,
and low prices for lands, and as possessing
social attractions for them, because it had early obtained
an unusually large German population.</p>

<p>The counties near Milwaukee were the first to receive
German settlers. This movement began about 1839,
and was very rapid. Soon after that, Sauk and Dane
counties became the favorites for new arrivals. Next,
immigrants from Germany went to the southwestern
counties, about Mineral Point, and northward into the
region about Lake Winnebago and the Fox River. By
1841 they had spread into Buffalo county, and along
the Mississippi River; but since 1860 they have chiefly
gone into the north central regions of the State, generally
preferring forest lands to prairies. The first
arrivals were mainly from the valley of the Rhine;
next in order, came people from southern Germany;
but the bulk of the settlers are from the northern and
middle provinces of their native land.</p>

<p>The principal Swiss groups in Wisconsin are in Green,
Buffalo, Sauk, Fond du Lac, and Taylor counties. That
at New Glarus, in Green county, is one of the most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
interesting. In the sterile little mountainous canton
of Glarus, in Switzerland, there was, about 1844, much
distress because of over population; the tillable land
was insufficient to raise food for all the people. It
was, therefore, resolved by them to send some of their
number to America, as a colony.</p>

<p>Two scouts were first dispatched, in the spring of
1845, with instructions to find a climate, a soil, and
general characteristics as nearly like Switzerland as
possible. These agents had many adventures as they
wandered through Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, before
finally selecting Green county, Wisconsin, as the place
best suited for their people.</p>

<p>It was supposed that those left behind would wait
until a report could be sent back to them. But one
hundred ninety-three of the intending emigrants soon
became restless, and started for America only a month
later than the advance guard. The party had a long
and very disagreeable journey, down the Rhine River
to the seaport, where after many sore trials they
obtained a vessel to take them across the Atlantic.
This ship was intended for the accommodation of only
one hundred forty passengers; but nearly two hundred
crowded into it, and had a tempestuous and generally
disheartening passage of forty-nine days, with insufficient
food.</p>

<p>At last, reaching Baltimore, they proceeded by canal
boat to the foot of the Alleghanies, crossed the mountains
by a crude railway, and then embarked in a
steamer down the Ohio River, bound for St. Louis.
After their arrival at that city, there ensued a long and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
vexatious search for the scouts, who, not expecting them,
had left few traces behind. But perseverance finally won,
and by the middle of August all of these weary colonists
were reunited in the promised land of New Glarus,
five thousand miles away from their native valleys.</p>

<p>The experience of the first few years was filled with
privations, because these poor Swiss, fresh from narrow
fields and small shops at home, did not comprehend the
larger American methods of farming, with horse and
plow. But, by the kindness of their American neighbors,
they finally learned their rude lessons; and, soon
adopting the profitable business of manufacturing Swiss
cheese, by thrift and industry they in time succeeded
in making of New Glarus one of the most prosperous
agricultural regions in Wisconsin.</p>

<p>It is estimated that in Green county there are now
eight thousand persons of Swiss birth, or the descendants
of Swiss, about one-third of the entire population.
The language which they still use in business
affairs is the German-Swiss dialect.</p>

<p class="caption splitr">FIRST NORWEGIAN CHURCH</p>

<p>The first Norwegian immigrants to America arrived
in 1825, after some strange adventures on
the ocean, and settled in the
State of New York; this
was before Wisconsin was
ready for settlers. From
1836 to 1845, thousands of
Norwegians came to Illinois
and Wisconsin, their first settlement
in Wisconsin being made in
1844, in the town of Albion, Dane county. They are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
now scattered quite generally over the State, in large
groups, with hundreds of ministers and churches, and
many newspapers; but they are still strongest in Dane
county, where, probably, there are not less than fourteen
thousand who were either born in Norway or are
the children of Norwegian-born parents.</p>

<p>The Belgians are closely massed in certain towns of
Door, Kewaunee, and Brown counties, in the northeastern
portion of the State. The beginning of their
immigration was in 1853, when ten families of the
province of Brabant, in Belgium, determined to move
to America, where they could win a better support
for themselves, and suitably educate their children.
The vessel in which they crossed the Atlantic was
forty-eight days in sailing from Antwerp to New
York, the passage being tedious and rough, accompanied
by several terrific hurricanes. The poor pilgrims
suffered from hunger and thirst, as well as sickness,
and lost one of their number by death.</p>

<p>It was while on board ship that the majority decided
to settle in Wisconsin, and upon landing, hither they
promptly came. Arriving in Milwaukee, they knew
not what part of the State was best suited for them;
but began to prospect for land, and finally settled
near Green Bay, simply because a large portion of
the population of that village could speak French,
which was their own language. At first they had determined
to locate near Sheboygan, but were annoyed
at not being able to make themselves understood by the
inhabitants of that place. The little band of Belgians
was at last established within rude log huts, in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
heart of a dense forest, ten miles from any other human
habitation, without roads or bridges, or even horses or
cattle. They experienced the worst possible inconveniences
and hardships naturally appertaining to life in
the frontier woods, and for the first year or two the
colony seemed in a desperate condition. Its hopeful
members, however, hiding their present misery, sent
cheerful letters home, and enticed their old neighbors
either to join them, or to form new settlements in the
neighborhood. In due time, the Belgians of northeastern
Wisconsin became prosperous farmers and merchants.</p>

<p>Similar tales might be related, of the great difficulties
and hardships bravely overcome by several other foreign
groups in Wisconsin: for instance, the Poles,
the Dutch, the Welsh, the Bohemians, the Cornishmen
of the lead-mine region, and the Icelandic fishermen
of lonely Washington Island. But the foregoing will
suffice to show of what sturdy stuff our foreign-born
peoples are made, and cause us to rejoice that such
material has gone into the upbuilding of our commonwealth.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span></p>

<h2 id="SWEPT_BY_FIRE">SWEPT BY FIRE</h2>

<p>Before the great inrush of agricultural settlers, in
1836, most of the surface of Wisconsin was covered
with dense forests. In the northern portion of
the State, pines, hemlocks, and spruce predominated,
mingled with large areas of hard wood; elsewhere,
hard wood chiefly prevailed, the forests in the southern
and eastern portions being frequently broken by
large prairies and by small treeless "openings."</p>

<p>In the great northern pine woods, lumbermen have
been busy for many years. They leave in their wake
great wastes of land, some of it covered with dead
branches from the trees that have been felled and
trimmed; some so sterile that the sun, now allowed to
enter, in a rainless summer bakes the earth and dries
the spongy swamps; while all about are great masses
of dead stumps, blasted trunks, and other forest d&eacute;bris.
Settlers soon pour in, purchase the best of this cut-over
land, and clear the ground for farms. But there are
still left in Wisconsin great stretches of deforested
country, as yet unsettled; some of these areas are
worthless except for growing new forests, an enterprise
which, some day, the State government will undertake
for the benefit of the commonwealth.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>Now and then, in dry seasons, great fires start upon
these "pine barrens," or "slashings," as they are called,
and spread until often they cause great loss to life and
property. These conflagrations originate in many ways,
chiefly from the carelessness of hunters or Indians, in
their camps, or from sparks from locomotives, or bonfires
built by farmers for the destruction of rubbish.</p>

<p>Nearly every summer and autumn these forest fires
occur more or less frequently in northern Wisconsin,
working much damage in their neighborhoods; but
usually they exhaust themselves when they reach a
swamp, a river, or cleared fields. When, however,
there has been an exceptionally long period of drought,
everything in the cut-over lands becomes excessively<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
dry; the light, thin soil, filled with dead roots and
encumbered by branches and stumps, becomes as inflammable
as tinder; the dried-up marshes generate
explosive gases.</p>

<p>The roaring flames, once started in such a season,
are fanned by the winds which the heat generates, and,
gathering strength, roll forward with resistless impetus;
dense, resinous forest growths succumb before
their assault, rivers are leaped by columns of fire, and
everything goes down before the destroyer. In a holocaust
of this character, all ordinary means of fire fighting
are in vain; the houses and barns of settlers feed
the devouring giant, whole towns are swept away, until
at last the flames either find nothing further upon which
to feed, or are quenched by a storm of rain.</p>

<p>The most disastrous forest conflagration which Wisconsin
has known, occurred during the 8th and 9th of
October, 1871. There had been a winter with little
snow, and a long, dry summer. Fires had been
noticed in the pine forests which line the shores of
Green Bay, as early as the first week in September.
At first they did not create much alarm; they smouldered
along the ground through the vegetable mold,
underbrush, and "slashings," occasionally eating out
the roots of a great tree, which, swayed by the wind,
would topple over with a roar, and send skyward a
shower of sparks.</p>

<p>Gradually the "fire belt" broadened, and, finding
better fuel, the flames strengthened; the swamps
began to burn, to a depth of several feet; over hundreds
of square miles the air was thick and stifling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
with smoke, so that the sun at noonday appeared like
a great copper ball set on high; at night the heavens
were lurid. Miles of burning woods were everywhere
to be seen; hundreds of haystacks in the meadows, and
great piles of logs and railroad ties and telegraph poles
were destroyed.</p>

<p>For many weeks the towns along the bay shore were
surrounded by cordons of threatening flame. The people
of Pensaukee, Oconto, Little Suamico, Sturgeon
Bay, Peshtigo, and scores of other settlements, were
frequently called out by the fire bells to fight the insidious
enemy; many a time were they apparently
doomed to destruction, but constant vigilance and
these occasional skirmishes for a time saved them.</p>

<p>Reports now began to come in, thick and fast, of
settlers driven from blazing homes, of isolated sawmills
and lumber camps destroyed, of bridges consumed, of
thrilling escapes by lumbermen and farmers. On
Sunday, the 8th of October, a two days' carnival of
death began. In Brown, Kewaunee, Oconto, Door,
Manitowoc, and Shawano counties the flames, suddenly
rising, swept everything within their path. Where thriving,
prosperous villages once had stood, blackened wastes
appeared. Over a thousand lives were lost, nearly as
many persons were crippled, and three thousand were
in a few hours reduced to beggary. The horrors of the
scenes at New Franken, Peshtigo, and the Sugar Bush,
in particular, were such as cannot be described.</p>

<p>This appalling tragedy chanced to occur at the same
time as vast prairie fires in Minnesota, and the terrible
conflagration which destroyed Chicago. The civilized<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
world stood aghast at the broad extent of the field of
needed relief; nevertheless, the frenzied appeals for
aid, issued in behalf of the Wisconsin fire sufferers,
met with as generous a response as if they alone, in
that fateful month of October, were the recipients of
the nation's bounty. Train loads of clothing and
provisions, from nearly every State in the Union, soon
poured into Green Bay, which was the center of distribution;
the United States government made large gifts
of clothing and rations; nearly two hundred thousand
dollars were raised, and expended under official control;
and great emergency hospitals were opened at various
points, for the treatment of sick and wounded.</p>

<p>As for the actual financial loss to the people of the
burned district, that could never be estimated. The
soil was, in many places, burned to the depth of several
feet, nothing being left but sand and ashes; grass
roots were destroyed; bridges and culverts were gone;
houses, barns, cattle, tools, seed, and crops were no
more. It was several years before the region began
again to exhibit signs of prosperity.</p>

<p>In the year 1894, forest fires of an appalling magnitude
once more visited Wisconsin, this time in the
northwestern corner of the State. Again had there been
an exceptionally dry winter, spring, and summer. The
experience gained by lumbermen and forest settlers
had made them more cautious than before, and more
expert in the fighting of fires; but that year was one in
which no human knowledge seemed to avail against the
progress of flames once started on their career of devastation.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span></p>

<p>During the summer, several fires had burned over
large areas. By the last week of July, it was estimated
that five million dollars' worth of standing pine had
been destroyed. The burned and burning area was
now over fifty miles in width, the northern limit being
some forty miles south of Superior. Upon the 27th
of the month, the prosperous town of Phillips, wholly
surrounded by deforested lands, was suddenly licked
up by the creeping flames, the terrified inhabitants
escaping by the aid of a railway train. Neighboring
towns, which suffered to a somewhat less degree, were
Mason, Barronett, and Shell Lake.</p>

<p>In 1898 Wisconsin was again a heavy sufferer from
the same cause. The fires were chiefly in Barron
county, upon the 29th and 30th of September. Two
hundred fifty-eight families were left destitute, and the
loss to land and property was estimated at $400,000.
Relief agencies were established in various cities of the
state, and our people responded as liberally to the
urgent call for help as they had in 1871 and 1894.</p>

<p>A more competent official system of scientifically
caring for our forests, restricting the present wasteful
cutting of timber, and preventing and fighting forest
fires, would be of incalculable benefit to the State of
Wisconsin. The annual loss by burning is alone a
terrible drain upon the resources of the people, to say
nothing of the death and untold misery which stalk in
the wake of a forest fire.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span></p>

<h2 id="BADGERS_IN_WAR_TIME">BADGERS IN WAR TIME</h2>

<p>The men of Wisconsin who had fought and conquered
the hard conditions of frontier life, developing
a raw wilderness into a wealthy and progressive
commonwealth, were of the sort to make the best of
soldiers when called upon to take up arms in behalf of
the nation.</p>

<p>From the earliest days of the War of Secession until
its close, Wisconsin troops were ever upon the firing
line, and participated in some of the noblest victories
of the long and painful struggle. General Sherman, in
his "Memoirs," paid them this rare tribute: "We estimated
a Wisconsin regiment equal to an ordinary brigade."
It is impracticable in one brief chapter to do
more than mention a few of the most brilliant achievements
of the Badger troops.</p>

<p>In April, 1862, the Fourteenth, Sixteenth, and Eighteenth
Wisconsin infantry regiments, although new in
the service, won imperishable laurels upon the bloody
field of Shiloh. The men of the Fourteenth were especially
prominent in the fray. Arriving on the ground
at midnight of the first day, they passed the rest of the
night in a pelting rain, standing ankle-deep in mud;
and throughout all the next day fought as though they
were hardened veterans.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span></p>

<p>A Kentucky regiment was ordered to charge a Confederate
battery, but fell back in confusion; whereupon
General Grant asked if the Fourteenth Wisconsin could
do the work. Its colonel cried, "We will try!" and
then followed one of the most gallant charges of the
entire war. Thrice driven back, the Wisconsin men
finally captured the battery; confusion ensued in the
Confederate ranks, and very soon the battle of Shiloh
was a Union victory.</p>

<p>In the Peninsular campaign of the same year, the
Fifth Regiment made a bayonet charge which routed
and scattered the Confederates, and turned the scales
in favor of the North. In an address to the regiment
two days later, General McClellan declared: "Through
you we won the day, and Williamsburg shall be inscribed
on your banner. Your country owes you its grateful
thanks." His report to the War Department describes
this charge as "brilliant in the extreme."</p>

<p>Some of the highest honors of the war were awarded
to the gallant Iron Brigade, composed of the Second,
Sixth, and Seventh Wisconsin, the Nineteenth Indiana,
and the Twenty-fourth Michigan. At Gainesville, in
the Shenandoah Valley campaign, also in 1862, this
brigade practically won the fight, the brunt of the Confederate
assault being met by the Second Wisconsin,
which that day lost sixty per cent of its rank and file;
the brigade itself suffered a loss of nine hundred men.</p>

<p>The Third opened the battle at Cedar Mountain,
and very soon after that was at Antietam, where it
lost two-thirds of the men it took into action. The
Fifth also was prominent near by, and the Iron Brigade,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
behind a rail fence, conducted a fight which was
one of the chief events of the engagement.</p>

<p>At the battle of Corinth, several Wisconsin regiments
and four of her batteries won some of the brightest
honors. In the various official reports of the action,
such comments as the following are frequent: "This
regiment (the Fourteenth) was the one to rely upon in
every emergency;" a fearless dash by the Seventeenth
regiment, one general described as "the most glorious
charge of the campaign"; there was an allusion to
the Eighteenth's "most effectual service"; in referring
to the Sixth battery, mention is made in the reports,
of "its noble work."</p>

<p>At Chaplin Hills, in Kentucky, a few days later, the
First Wisconsin drove back the enemy several times,
and captured a stand of Confederate colors. The Tenth
was seven hours under fire, and lost fifty-four per cent
of its number. General Rousseau highly praised both
regiments, saying, "These brave men are entitled to
the gratitude of the country." The Fifteenth captured
heavy stores of ammunition and many prisoners; the
Twenty-fifth repulsed, with withering fire, a superior
force of the enemy, who had suddenly assaulted them
while lying in a cornfield; and the Fifth battery three
times turned back a Confederate charge, "saving the
division," as General McCook reported, "from a disgraceful
defeat."</p>

<p>At Prairie Grove, in Arkansas, at Fredericksburg,
and at Stone River, still later in the campaign of 1862,
Wisconsin soldiers exhibited what General Sherman
described as "splendid conduct, bravery, and efficiency."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span></p>

<p>Men of Wisconsin were also prominent in the Army
of the Potomac, during the famous "mud campaign" of
the early months of 1863. At the crossing of the Rappahannock,
theirs was the dangerous duty to protect the
makers of the pontoon bridges. In the course of this
service, the Iron Brigade made a splendid dash across
the river, charged up the opposite heights, and at the
point of the bayonet routed the Confederates who were
intrenched in rifle pits.</p>

<p>At Chancellorsville, the Third Wisconsin, detailed to
act as a barrier to the advance of the Confederates
under Stonewall Jackson, was the last to leave the illfated
field.</p>

<p>At Fredericksburg, not far away, the Fifth Wisconsin
and the Sixth Maine led a desperate charge up Marye's
Hill, where, in a sunken roadway, lay a large force of
the enemy; this force, a few months before, had killed
six thousand Union men who were vainly attempting to
rout them. This second and final charge overcame all
difficulties, and succeeded. As the Confederate commander
handed to the colonel of the Wisconsin regiment
his sword and silver spurs, he told the victor that
he had supposed there were not enough troops in the
Army of the Potomac to carry the position; it was, he
declared, the most daring assault he had ever seen.
Such, too, was the judgment of Greeley, who declared
that "Braver men never smiled on death than those
who climbed Marye's Hill on that fatal day." The
correspondent of the <i>London Times</i> also wrote, "Never
at Fontenoy, Albuera, nor at Waterloo was more
undaunted courage displayed."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span></p>

<p>In the campaign which resulted in the fall of Vicksburg,
in 1863, numerous Wisconsin regiments participated,
many of them with conspicuous gallantry. It
was an officer of the Twenty-third who received, at the
base of the works, the offer of the Confederates to
surrender.</p>

<p>The part taken by Wisconsin troops at Gettysburg,
was conspicuous. The Iron Brigade and a Wisconsin
company of sharpshooters were, day by day, in the
thickest of the fight, and gained a splendid record. At
Chickamauga, several of our regiments fought under
General Thomas, and lost heavily. They afterward
participated in the struggle at Mission Ridge, which
resulted in the Confederate army under Bragg being
turned back into Central Georgia.</p>

<p>The Iron Brigade was in Grant's campaign against
Richmond, serving gallantly in the battles of the Wilderness,
in the "bloody angle" at Spottsylvania, at Fair
Oaks, and in the numerous attacks before Petersburg.</p>

<p>Wisconsin contributed heavily to the army of Sherman,
in his "march to the sea," and in the preliminary
contests won distinction on many a bitterly contested
field. Several of our regiments were in the assault on
Mobile, the day when Lee was surrendering to Grant,
in far-off Virginia. Others of the Badger troops, infantry
and cavalry, served in Louisiana, Texas, and
Arkansas, fighting the Confederate guerillas, while
our artillerymen were distributed throughout the several
Union armies, and served gallantly until the last
days of the war.</p>

<p>Wisconsin soldiers languished in most of the great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
Southern military prisons. A thrilling escape of Union
men from Libby Prison, at Richmond, was made in February,
1864, by means of a secret tunnel. This was
ingeniously excavated under the superintendence of a
party of which Colonel H. C. Hobart of the Twenty-first
Wisconsin was a leader.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/image241.jpg" width="600" height="377" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Another notable event of the war, of which a Wisconsin
man was the hero, occurred during the night of
the 27th of October, 1864. The Confederate armored
ram <i>Albemarle</i>, after having sunk several Union vessels,
was anchored off Plymouth, North Carolina, a town
which was being attacked by Federal troops and ships.
Lieutenant W. B. Cushing of Delafield, Waukesha
county, proceeded to the <i>Albemarle</i> in a small launch,
under cover of the dark; and, in the midst of a sharp
fire from the crew of the ram, placed a torpedo under
her bow and blew her up. The daring young officer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
escaped to his ship, amid appalling difficulties, having
won worldwide renown by his splendid feat.</p>

<p>The saving of the Union fleet in the Red River was
an incident which attracted national attention to still
another Wisconsin man. The expedition up the river,
into the heart of the enemy's country, was a failure, and
immediate retreat inevitable. But the water had lowered,
and the fleet of gunboats found it impossible to
descend the rapids at Alexandria. The enemy were
swarming upon the banks, and the situation was so
hazardous that it seemed as if the army would find it
necessary to desert the vessels. Lieutenant Colonel
Joseph Bailey of the Fourth Wisconsin infantry, serving
as chief engineer on General Franklin's staff, proposed
to dam the river, then suddenly make an opening,
and allow the boats to emerge with the outrush of imprisoned
water. The plan is a familiar one to Wisconsin
lumbermen, in getting logs over shoals; but it was
new to the other officers, and Bailey was laughed at as
a visionary. However, the situation was so desperate
that he was allowed to try his experiment. It succeeded
admirably; the fleet, worth nearly two millions of dollars,
was saved, and the expedition emerged from the
trap in good order. Bailey was made a brigadier general,
and the grateful naval officers presented him with
a valuable sword and vase.</p>

<p>No account of Wisconsin's part in the War of Secession
should, however brief, omit reference to a conspicuous
participant, "Old Abe," the war eagle of the
Eighth Regiment. He was captured by an Indian, on the
Flambeau River, a branch of the Chippewa, and until<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
the close of the long struggle was carried on a perch by
his owners, the men of Company C. He was an eyewitness
of thirty-six battles and skirmishes, and accompanied
his regiment upon some of the longest marches
of the war. Frequently he was hit by the enemy's bullets,
but never was daunted, his habit in times of action
being to pose upon his perch or a cannon, screaming
lustily, and frequently holding in his bill the corner of a
flag. No general in the great struggle achieved a wider
celebrity than "Old Abe." Until his death, in 1881, he
was exhibited in all parts of the country, at State and
national soldiers' reunions, and at fairs held for their
benefit. At the great Sanitary Fair in Chicago, in 1865,
it is said that the sales of his photographs brought
$16,000 to the soldiers' relief fund.</p>

<p>Upon the opening of the Spanish-American War, in
April, 1898, Wisconsin's militia system was one of the
best in the country, and its quota of 5390 volunteers
was made up from these companies.</p>

<p>The First Regiment was sent to Camp Cuba Libre, at
Jacksonville, Florida; the Second and Third to Camp
Thomas, at Chickamauga; and the Fourth, at first to
the State military camp at Camp Douglas, and later to
Camp Shipp, Alabama. The First was the earliest
raised, and the best equipped, but its colonel's commission
was not so old as those held by the other regimental
commanders from this State; therefore, when two
Wisconsin regiments were to be sent in July to Puerto
Rico, the Second and Third were selected, leaving the
First reluctantly to spend its entire time in camp. After
the war, it had been intended to detail the Fourth,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
not mustered in until late in the struggle, to join the
American army of occupation in the West Indies; but,
owing to the fact that a large percentage of the men
were suffering from camp diseases, they were finally
mustered out without leaving the country.</p>

<p>The Second and Third had an interesting experience
in Puerto Rico. Arriving at the port of Guamico upon
the 25th of July, they took a prominent part in the
bloodless capture of the neighboring city of Ponce.
This task completed, they were detailed, with the Sixteenth
Pennsylvania, to form the advance guard of the
army, which prepared at once to sweep the island from
south to north. Our men were almost daily under fire,
particularly in road clearing skirmishes under General
Roy Stone.</p>

<p>Two days after the landing at Guamico, Lieutenant
Perry Cochrane, of Eau Claire, an officer of the Third,
was sent forward with seventeen other Eau Claire men,
to open up the railway line leading to the little village
of Yauco, lying about twenty miles westward of Ponce,
and to capture that place. The track and the bridges
had been wrecked by the fleeing enemy, so that
Cochrane's party endured much peril and fatigue before
they reached their destination; and Yauco was not
disposed to succumb to this handful of men. Cochrane
successfully held his own, however, until the following
day, when re&euml;nforcements arrived.</p>

<p>A few days after the fall of Ponce, the Sheboygan
company was acting as guard to a detachment repairing
the San Juan road, several miles out of town. Hearing
that a party of Spanish soldiers had taken a stand at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
Lares, eighteen miles away, a detail was sent with a flag
of truce, to treat with them. The squad consisted of
Lieutenant Bodemer, four privates, and a bugler. The
Spaniards were not in a pleasant frame of mind, and
but for their officers would have made short shrift of
the visitors, despite the peaceful flag which they bore.
Finally, the Spaniards agreed to receive a deputation of
native Puerto Ricans, and talk the matter over with
them. Our men withdrew, and sent natives in their
stead; but the latter were treacherously assaulted, and
only one of them escaped to tell the story.</p>

<p>Upon the 9th of August, there was a sharp fight at
Coamo. Both of our regiments were actively employed
in this encounter, and were of the troops which finally
raised the American flag over the town walls.</p>

<p>The final engagement was fought two days later, at
the mountain pass of Asomanta, near Aibonito, where
2500 Spanish troops were centered. The Second Wisconsin
was the last American regiment in this fight, and
lost two killed and three wounded. These were Wisconsin's
only field losses during the war, although her
deaths from camp diseases were about seventy.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
